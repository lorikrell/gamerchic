## Of Smartie Chips and Inquisitions

On to the Double Down, the crew seeks out some help with the smart drive. It had three folders of content that spelled certain doom, a weird etched symbol, and a potential fall out that could hurt them all...or worse!

After a couple drinks, they find Beckett and Roscoe to chat with and figure out what the hell they have. The drive turns out to be a collection of investigative information being sent to Mexico for an Inquisitor, one named Vargus. 

He is expecting the files, those that do not complete delivery may find themselves dead. The content is part of investigations either by the Inquisitors, for their work, or stolen and being provided. While they discuss, a friend of Beckett's called Zelios gives insights of blood magic on the etching.

Concerned and suddenly intrigued, they follow Beckett's advice and seek out a specialized antiques and magic expert: Bastien Wathan of Tremere.

After getting access through Beckett and Zelios, the crew walks through a sedate warehouse guarded by dogs and filled with antiques. Furnishings, books, jewelry, a wide mix of fine antiques set out in groups or packed away in rows of shelves and crates. A few had strange markings around them on the floor, magic circles, and the like either as protection or just a creepy setup.

The meeting leads to a tense moment, Bastien demands to know why he should not kill the mortals...leading to the flash of black cards. AH yes, special envoys of the Accords. He passes their cards through a reader, mistaking Eden for the courier, and sets to reviewing the drive mark.

There is magic, it's failing, perhaps a few days left. 

He then welcomes Zelios to remain and review a few items he has, excited to meet the cainite. Beckett he sends away with the mortals, informing him their meeting is not until the next night.

As they leave, Donovan spies a strange door, Eden steals an ivory necklace, and Kimber gets a lead on a possible job there. They all retire to Griffin, a bar with an open flame, learning vampires are scared of fire! The night ends with drinks, relaxing chat, and Eden leaving with Rosalind and Butch.

Gangrel, 9th Gen, Sire Manuel the Coyote, Vegas

Born 8th in a family of 10 children, Roscoe's mother declared his long name after her favorite love interest in the Dukes of Hazard. He lived a damn hard life from that very night, leaving home to drive with his dad, a truck driver, across the country at twelve. When he hit 15, he stole a Harley from his mother's ex-ex-boyfriend. He fell in with a rebel group, the Tramposos Muerte (Death Cheaters), out of El Paso.

Just his luck they were vampire blood runners, moving between Texas and Mexico, through Arizona and California. He lived and fought by their sides, the rough elements and warfare, protecting transports and blood with his Brujah and Gangrel friends, until they finally embraced him in a hell on wheels tournament: fighting from bike back with chains swinging hooks set on fire!

He became fast friends with Smiling Jack, watching his back, playing the angel on his shoulder, and trying to get them through capers.

His friends staked him, threw him in a casket, and called in an old favor with Jake in Austin. Roscoe woke and wept, for his friend, his sire, his entire world falling down.

For the next decade, he got back on his feet, made the best of his new life while watching for news in California. He embraced a kid named Jim Bob, taught him the ropes, helped take down the Camarilla in Austin, and helped Jake keep his piece of the pie in Austin with the power change.

## Spotlight: Shane Dorn

Ventrue Anti-tribu Sabbat, 10th Gen, Sire Melansie Bordelon, "The Deposed Prince", Austin

Few ever had the audacity to change their lives so drastically as Serena Dorn did in her embrace. Cutting away the soft woman of priviledge, she transformed herself into a beast of power, business, and knowledge taking the guise and life of a man. Never one to squander a turn, Shane (no longer Serena) rose ahead of the ghouls then childer in her sire's stead, earning the right to take his ventures into the colonies. She battled through revolution, the Civil War, and into the blossoming of a new era. Never has she become complacent or turned away an idea.

So it was she made alliance with a questionable Lasombra with a gem of an idea. With the means and capability, she took control of initiatives and claimed Austin, donning the title of Prince with her false persona of Camarilla Ventrue. All was well until a the status quo changed so drastically with the arrival of Maxmillian from England. Deposed, lesser in stature, and ready to tear apart the new prince, she stepped up plans with Victor. Little did she know he had made plans as well.

Together they overthrew the prince, plans and killing blows commited by the Dirty Deeds pack of Sabbat. Titles moved to Victor as he rose to Bishop, and Dorn was left with meager position and opportunity. Making the best of it, Dorn has taken charge of the city, delved further into finance, land deeds, and took up vested interests to surround Victor by law if not arms. 

It's just a matter of time before he feels the hungering claws of Dorn around his neck...
