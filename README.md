# Gamerchic

Welcome to the code repo for Sonceri.art / Gamerchic.org, gamer resources for tabletop and MMO RPGs. Find resources, settings, homebrews, templates, and more to enliven your games and craft characters. Some templates available do require Photoshop, Affinity Designer, or Photopea to use.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), my favorite doc tool!
