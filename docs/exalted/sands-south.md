Opala hummed to herself, twirling cards within hands newly dipped into lineament and myruhhin to stay limber for a long day of work. Combs held her hair in twisted braids, heated rocks tucked within to help lock in those lovely curls she was known for. A mask of red clay cracked over her cheeks, about her eyes, clean and rested leaving a touch of color to heighten a youth she lost.

A steaming pot of chocha steeped away, for that perfect bitterness to combine with spice cubes and grain sugar. A morning bun of jasmine, currandir, and fig laid forgotten if missing a bite or two. She had perhaps two hours before the early lunch rush would fill her table with officials seeking insight to gain position, mother’s eager for matrimony for their children, sultans wishing just a light bit of conversation while waiting for their meetings, and lovers new and spurned.

Cards fell into patterns. The flaming cup, the lost road, the single lute with cut strings but one, the empress blinded, the warrior climbing or falling upon a cliff. Each of the backs had the slightest change in color, in the feathers of a large peacock. So festooned in details, no one caught on to her tricks. The deck served her well, thick and enameled, some form of shell perhaps, though she never questioned the make.

A shadow marred the edges of her vision, someone come too early, taking the seat of pillows across from her. “Afraid I am not reading yet, ju’sha. Come when we open for luncheon.”

A hand tattooed in henna and fesa reached across to pull a card, flipping it before her. A thrill of lightening traveled along her spine. How long had it been since this visitor appeared, to turn cards, disappearing the moment she peered up? Months? A year? Holding breath, she watched for the design to lay upward.

Usually something intriguing displayed, coming up in her daily life within the week. But this once, something new met her gaze. A card not of this desk, yet with the same back! A gentleman with a wide hat, long golden hair burnished by the sun, a single bright eye like a gem peeking from the brim. He wore traveling clothing, swathed in gold, beads, a scarf of dawn scattered to night. Under his boots wound a path neverending upon shifting waves, entering and leaving, with a series of stars within the ripples of his steps.

“Ruvia, travels through the deserts, waves of red gold sands parted before him. Be watchful, he comes with a message, but his steps may become wayward.”

Her fingers sought the card, touching his for a moment, something aching and familiar. Yet when she raised it from his, glancing to where he sat, nothing remained. Only the card.

## Welcome to the South!

Ur’fan Arel’ka! Welcome friends!
