A unit includes an image for placing on maps in battles and a stat block using these rules. To sign up for a Discord vehicle battle, you will post your Unit stat block, roll for initiative and post it, a description for your unit, and an image token.

* **Size:** Small, Medium, and Large determine the hit points and number of abilities/perks and possible additional charges. For stat blocks in this guide, the Size is noted in Concept.
* **HP:** Hit Points for the unit. These are 150 for Small, 250 for Medium, and 350 for Large.
* **Action Roll:** All vehicle have a base action roll roll of 1d100 that can be used for damaging attacks or heals. You can take perks to increase this amount or add an amount to the result.
* **Damage Resistance:** The types of damage you subtract -25 from the amount dealt. When someone rolls an attack, they state the one damage type used for you to determine how much you take. You start with 2 resistances.
* **Damage Weakness:** The type of damage you take an additional +25 damage from. When someone rolls an attack, they state the one damage type used for you to determine how much you take. You start with 1 weakness.
* **Damage Type:** The types of damage you deal with the unit. When posting your attack damage, you must post which one of these is dealt. You start with 2 types.
* **Healing Type:** The types of healing you deal with the unit. When posting your healing amount, you must post which one of these is dealt. You start with 1 type.
* **Perks/Abilities:** All of the abilities either are always active/passive or have charges. Each ability notes when you can use charges including use on your round, use when hit and take damage, use when you roll, or use anytime.

Here is an example unit:

Here is a template for creating a unit:

UNIT NAME:
* Concept/Size: 
* HP: 
* Action Roll: 
* Damage Resistance: reduce -25 damage from 
* Damage Weakness: take +25 extra damage from 
* Damage Type: 
* Healing Type: 
* Perks/Abilities: 

To create graphic tokens, see [Vehicle Battle Tokens](intro). You can craft your own or find one through libraries including [Sonceri's Battle Tokens](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Trn2hg7KyClWY3FemK_43al4TEEMGZLa) and the [Warcraft Conquest Token Library](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1JTp-cFxT3RAdBbJVrUp4ss8XwRe0-J2d).

## Health and Perks
HP is your Health Pool or the amount of hit points your unit has. As you battle, damage attacks reduce the amount down to zero. Healing refill your HP up to the max you started at. There are many ways to avoid damage including using perks like evasion, having another unit intervene, and more. 

The size is not the physical size of your unit but the size of the health pool and perks!

<div class="info-rows">

| | | |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Small | 150 | 5 Perks/Abilities, 0 extra charges |
| Medium | 250 | 4 Perks/Abilities, 1 extra charges to put in ANY chosen perk/ability |
| Large | 350 | 3 Perks/Abilities, 2 extra charges to put in ANY chosen perk/ability |

## Damage Types for Resistance and Weakness

Warcraft has endless types of magic, healing, damage, and more across classes, enemies, and worlds. This list breaks down the system into groups as best as possible for damage types without having a ridiculously long list. Each type has descriptions of what may best fit in these damage types. Is it perfect? No. But it works!

**Damage Resistance:** Pick 2 types of damage you are resistant to giving -25 damage taken.

**Damage Weakness:** Pick 1 damage type you are weak to causing your unit to take +25 damage of that type.

Select from the following types:

<div class="info-rows">

| | |
| -- | -- |
| Physical Blows | swords, gunfire, archery, cannons, ramming, bite, claw |
| Arcane Spellwork | arcanist power, mage, druid, blue dragonflight, bronze dragonflight |
| Elemental Focus | fire, water, earth, thunder, lightning, black dragonflight |
| Bound by Light | Holy Light, paladin, priest |
| Nature’s Grasp | nature, druidic, monk chi, nightmare, green dragonflight, red dragonflight |
| Shadow and Death | shadow, void, blood, undeath |
| Felfire | fel, demonic, twisting nether |

</div>

:::warning Damage Types
Only use the options in this table and keep the same language. This is crucial for the events to work properly. Enemies and Players will all use the same descriptors which can affect damage and healing.
:::

## Action Rolls

All action rolls are 1d100 base. The type of damage/healing you do is important to note. 
For Damage Attacks, the type informs the target what kind of damage it is when determining their final HP after the attack. This affects damage resistance and weakness selected above. When you post your attack, you must state if it is one of these damage types. The attacked target then may take more or less damage depending on their Resistance or Weakness.

DMs may keep weaknesses hidden for enemies in the turn order, revealing them through the battle. And DMs will attack without knowing your unit’s weaknesses and resistances.

Healing Type may come up in some situations based on healing abilities (San’layn Touch) or special rules for the event. DMs are encouraged to play with Healing Type, and players can have fun using this with their roleplay and storybuilding. For example, healing could be an attack vs an enemy!
:::

:::note Example Usage
Feris the druid heals an elemental construct ally using Nature’s Grasp healing type to imbue and repair the form. He rolls 60. At the end of that post, the entry is **(+60 healing Nature’s Grasp to Flame Elemental @discordname)**.
