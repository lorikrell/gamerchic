Welcome to the War of Legends, a system for running mass combat as missions and warfronts! This system is a riff off of D20 Warcraft systems with hit points, combat rolls, and perks or abilities that you can use to attack enemies, protect friends, tank, and heal. You can use these rules and run with them in Discord using graphics applications for maps, in virtual tabletops like Roll20, and in-game.

This guide provides all you need to create tokens, plan events, and run battles.

## What are vehicle battles?

Typically you may have heard of these events as Vehicle Battles through Warcraft Conquest. The original event allowed players to create different "vehicles" with stats and a graphic token, including tanks, planes, ships, large beasts, and squads like knights or cavalry. These events help players engage in mass combat battles like wars on sea, in air, and over land:

* Big battles with many enemies, mini bosses, and main bosses.
* Missions seeking specific goals on the map, may include skills and attacks.
* Derbies for comedic battles, last man standing wins, chariot races, and so on.
* Tournaments for exhibitions of battle and general PVP.

War of Legends expands the concept to mass combat and storytelling offering perks and abilities for different kinds of missions, wars, infiltration, and big boss battles. Perks and abilities include options for damage, healing, protection, and support. Each ability have charges and can be used in different ways, on your turn or in response to attacks. 

## Where do you use these rules?
Typically you can run these events through Discord for posting in a channel, like writing an interactive rp thread or novel. You can also use these rules directly in game using mounts and locations in game like a ship or defensive wall. 

A Dungeon Master (DM) lead uses graphic apps like Photoshop, Affinity Designer, and [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) online editor (Free) to layout the location, move tokens, and track health. You can also use virtual tabletops like Roll20, which can also be streamed through Discord! Additional DMs help run the enemy units, reacting to attacks and battling players.

## Creating Units
A unit includes a Health Pool (HP), an Action Roll for attacks and healing, perks and abilities, damage types, damage weaknesses, and damage resistances. This creates an easy way for a player to know what they can do, options during the battles, and strengths and weakness for intense strategizing and storytelling. The system supports heavy min maxer players and creative storybuilders.

* [Select Perks and Abilities](select-perks): Pick additional actions you can take during battle, including damage, healing, protection, and support

## Running War Games

You can run ANYTHING using these rules. Think of these as d20 tabletop games and events using visuals, much like a game run in Roll20. These rules and guidelines help to walk through running games and examples for strategy. Additional information will be added for running in Roll20 and creating visuals.
