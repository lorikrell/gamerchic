Perks and abilities provide all sorts of buffs, debuffs, passives, and actions your unit can take on their round of action, anytime they roll, or anytime to help others. These are broken up by categories for Damage, Support, Healing, and Protection. The perks and abilities detail when you can use these, such as your action round, anytime you roll, or anytime during the turn.

## Types of Perks

* Damage: Enhance your attacks, attack first, and more
* Support: Help your team by empowering attacks, calling for allies, hindering enemies, and more
* Healing: Shield and heal yourself and allies
* Protection: Protect your allies and weaken your enemies

Any unit can take any of these perks and abilities! You are not restricted to taking only from one category for your unit. Mix and match, see what works! You can also change these abilities according to the battles if you want to try out new options.

## How to Use Perks

The event is managed as a Turn with multiple Rounds. Players are put into the rounds based on the initiative they roll. This helps the DMs manage enemies and players to know when they can go. On your round, you can do anything: roll an attack or heal, or use an ability/perk. If you roll badly, you can elect to use a perk or ability instead. Some perks can be used on your turn, anytime you are prompted you roll, 

You can also get inventive using some of these perks. Some perks can be stacked and used together, as long as you have charges to use! For example, you could Return Fire when being attacked. If you have Aimed Shot and Multiattack, you could use those charges on your Return Fire attack. Sure you use up alot of charges, but you may need to for a pivotal moment.

Perks and Abilities include the following information in the tables: 

* **Perk**: Name of the perk or ability
* **#**: Number of charges or A for always active
* **Usage**: When you can use the perk/ability

  * **Roll**: Anytime you roll an attack, be it on your turn or in a response roll
  * **Round**: During your round of battle
  * **Any**: Literally anytime regardless if this is your attack round or not

* **Description**: What it does, capabilities, restrictions

| Aimed Shot | 2 | Roll | Roll twice, take highest roll! You can use this with other attack options like MultiAttack, Ramming, and more. Use it anytime you roll for attack. |
| MultiAttack | 2 | Roll | Roll 2 attacks this round, using both rolls. Can be stacked with other abilities. Aimed Shot can be used with this, 1 use only allows one of the rolls to be Aimed! Use it anytime you roll for attack. |
| Whirlwind | 2 | Roll | Do half of your damage roll result to all enemies in a tight area (adjacent squares in the grid). For example, if three enemies are all near each other on the board, and you roll 100 damage, all three take 50. Use it anytime you roll for attack. |
| Ramming | 2 | Roll | Rush and smash into your target! Add +25 to your attack damage, but take 25 damage yourself. Use it anytime you roll for attack. |
| Self Destruct | 1 | Round |  If the result is over 50, you do 200 damage split between all units directly around your current position. This permanently removes your unit from the event as they are completely destroyed. Use it on your round. |
| First Striker | A | - | You are in the first round of combat. |
| Exemplary Striker | A | - | Take one more Damage Type. You can only take this once. For example, your attacks could do Physical Blows, Shadow and Death, and add Felfire to your damage type. Any enemies you attack may take more damage from these selected types.  |
| Increased Damage | A | - | Take one more Damage Weakness to gain +25 base damage for a 1d125 roll. You can only take this once. For example, if you are weak to Arcane Spellwork, you add another weakness like Shadow and Death for the added base damage. |

## Support Perks

| Perk | # | Usage | Description |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Summon Ally | 1 | Round | Call a second unit (one character, a group of characters, one big thing) onto the field with one set of stats (no matter if the ally is one character or more). You can only call **ONE summon ally** (*you cannot recharge summon ally* to infinitely summon allies). You control this unit, rolling actions for it on your initiative. You use your action to call the unit. The unit can perform an action when summoned (attacking, healing, using their ability).<br/><br/>The unit has the following stats: 75 hp, 1d75 attack/heal, and pick one perk/ability from dmg/heal/protect which receives only 1 charge. For example, a healer ally with 1 charge Shield Ally. A summoned ally cannot have Summon Ally as a perk. If you have an active Bolster Forces or Empower buff on your unit when summoning, you can immediately use it on your ally that turn. This consumes the Bolster Forces or Empower buff. Or you can hold it and use it on your main unit for their next attack. |
| Mark for Death | 2 | Round | Place a mark on an enemy unit to kill! Like a bounty or focused target. Attacks on this unit deal an extra damage (+25 to result) for this round and the next round of combat. Use it on your round in place of an attack/healing. |
| Bolster Forces | 1 | Round | Give a rousing speech and call for battle! Inspire your friends in combat providing +25 to the result to all ally units on their next attack/healing. Use it on your round in place of an attack/healing. Can only have 1 Bolster Forces buff active on your units. This does stack with Marked for Death, Empower, etc. |
| Hinder Action | 2 | Round | Decrease the next attack/healing roll result by -50. Use it on your round in place of an attack/healing. |
| Empower Action | 2 | Round | Increase the next attack/healing roll result by +50. Use it on your round in place of an attack/healing. |
| Recharge | 2 | Any | Recharge an ability for another unit, returning a use of a perk/ability. You cannot use this on yourself. If you take a Summon Ally, that unit could have Recharge 1 charge to use on your main unit. Use anytime. |
| Increased Health | A | - | Take one more Damage Weakness to gain +50 base health. You can only take this once. For example, if you are weak to Felfire, you add another weakness like Bound by Light for the added base health. |

## Healing Perks

| Perk | # | Usage | Description |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Restoration | 2 | Round | Like Revival from the d20. Bring a unit back from 0 to half their base health. The method of restored life is flavor like fast repairs or calling on light or nature, etc. Use it on your round in place of an attack/healing. |
| Shield Ally | 2 | Any | Reduce all damage from all sources on yourself or another unit by -50 dmg for that round. If multiple enemies attack the player that round, all those attacks take -50 from their results. Use anytime. |
| Spirit of Healing | 2 | Roll | Become an empowered spirit of healing, performing two healing actions this round. Like Multi Attack, but rolling for healing instead of damage. Use it anytime you roll for healing. |
| Self Sacrifice | 2 | Roll | Take damage to heal (this is the Healer version of (P) Return Fire). Anytime you take damage, you can add this amount to a healing roll result in reaction to that attack. OR you can sacrifice your health to add that amount to a healing roll result on your turn. Divide the healing to as many units as you like. For example, you take 50 damage from a hit not on your round, then roll 1d100 and add +50 to the result to heal one or more units. Or on your round, sacrifice -50 health to add +50 to a rolled healing result. Use when attacked or on your round. You cannot use (P) Return Fire at the same time. |
| San’layn Touch | 2 | Roll | Steal health from a target and grant it as healing to another target. Roll healing as an attack to siphon health, redirecting it to themselves or another player as direct healing. If your healing type is a weakness for the enemy, you get that +25 to the siphoned amount. Use it on your round. |
| Exemplary Medic | A | - | You are an exemplary medic and all heals receive +25 to result. This stacks with other perks/abilities. You can only take this once. |
| Turn the Tides | 1 | Any | Change an enemy’s attack into healing for your allies. After an enemy has announced and posted their attack on a player, you can reach out and change this damage into healing for that player. Use anytime. |

## Protection Perks

| Return Fire | 2 | Roll | When you are attacked and take damage, make a counter attack on the attacker regardless of turn (rolling an attack). This does NOT eat your turn. This is also an attack, not healing. For healing when attacked, see (H) Self Sacrifice. You still take all the damage from the attack on you. You can stack other abilities when rolling for an attack, such as Aimed Shot, Whirlwind, MultiAttack, etc. Use when attacked. You cannot use (H) Self Sacrifice at the same time. |
| Evade | 1 | Any | Take no damage from 1 attack. Use anytime. Can be used on another. If you have two hits in the same round, you only evade one. |

| Weaken Enemy | 1 | Round | Permanently add 1 weakness damage type (from any of the listed Damage Types) to an enemy. An enemy can only have 1 added, unique weakness. For example, a boss may have a weakness to Arcane Spellwork and Felfire. You could add Elemental Focus if most of your allies do Elemental Focus damage. Use it on your round in place of an attack/healing. |
| Sabotage | 2 | Any | Cause an enemy unit to roll twice and take the LOWER result, rolling with disadvantage on an attack/heal. For example, counterspells and kicks, etc. Use anytime. **NOTE:** Sabotaging an Aimed Shot is being reviewed by the writers! |
| Exemplary Defender | A | - | Pick one more resistance option, giving you 3 total damage types you take less damage from. You can only take this once. |
