## Create Boss and Item Cards

These cards let you add art files and info for bosses players battle or meet or items they earn through events. 

1. Copy and paste your art into the art folder. Masks automatically will block out the art without fancy edits.
1. Edit the text with names, types, content, DM name(s), and the event name.
1. If available, show/hide icons.
1. Save as a *.png* file to keep the transparency. 

:::sonceri Lots of Items, One File!
To make life easier and keep the file size down, write content in a separate file like a Google Doc. Add the art to the file, giving the layer a name matching the card type. You can just save the art in this PSD, using copy/paste from the Google Doc if you ever need to tweak something.
