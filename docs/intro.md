The party gathers at a tavern, settled at a couple tables, sharing drinks and a tale. City guards (more thugs than lawful) push into the bustling crowds. Their gaze wanders face to face, until sudden movement draws their attention. A thief wearing a typical street kid's look springs from a table trying to escape. The guards give chase declaring everyone should go back to their drinks. Will you aid them, or wait for the shadowy merchant from the corner booth to call you over.
