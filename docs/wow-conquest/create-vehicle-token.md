With an idea for your build, and assets collected, it's time to create a ship! The best way to explain how to edit together a new vehicle. Check to make sure you have the major assets you need. As you build, you may need additional assets, requiring more captures and clean up. 

## The Inspiration

So let's get started! I found the original model for the Blood Elf Destroyer, but it has low quality assets, odd color, and could use some updating. For this example, I will create a new Sin'Dorei Destroyer using assets from the new heritage armor, board texture, a polearm, stained glass from the Sargeras raid, doors, and a few other things.

## Building the Base

Using methods for capturing content, start with the base or largest structure. From it, layer new assets, add sections, and expand on the creation. "Vehicles" include land-based tanks, cannons, turrets, wagon trains of doom, and the like. Naval has ships of various kinds, small boats to large cargo ships, huge carriers to flotillas. Air support includes small planes, gliders, wyverns and dragons, copters, planes, massive airships, and more.

Search and capture assets from existing vehicles to get started, from one of the tools or sites or the WC Google Drive. For this example, I found a small boat with a similar hull from BFA assets. I added pieces to add "wings" off the side and levels like a large ship. 

## Change Color

To change the shade of materials such as wood or metal, use Hue & Saturation, Color Replacement, 

### Hue & Saturation

1. Select content.
1. Select **Image** > **Adjustments** > **Hue/Saturation**.
1. Select Master to affect all colors, or select a specific color to change.
1. Shift the hue left and right through the spectrum, darken and lighten to find the right color.
1. If it does not give the desired effect, select Colorize and try again. This option desaturates the image then applies the color.

### Color Layer

1. Create a new layer. 
1. To restrict the color to an area, select a section before brushing on color. I recommend clicking the **Add Mask** button ![mask](/img/vehicle/mask.jpg) just for this layer. You can paint and paint, without editing the color of other layers.
1. To restrict the color to the content, right click on the new layer and **Add Clipping Mask**. 
1. Set the layer type to **Color**. ![color](/img/vehicle/color.jpg)
1. Pick a brush, a color, and start painting! You can get inventive with these options. Add as many layers as you need for color, color dodge, etc.

### Color Replacement

1. Select **Image** > **Adjustments** > **Replace Colors...**
1. Optional, if you are selecting similar colors (contiguuous), select **Localized Color Clusters**. 
1. Use the eyedropper to select colors, adding and removing as needed.
1. Change the fuzziness slider as needed, to add more or less based on shades.
1. Then the fun part, modify the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness sliders as needed or use the Color Picker to replace.

This option also has a brush tool:

1. Pick a color you want to paint with.
1. Select the Replace Color brush, hold down the brushes to see it.

    ![Color Replace](/img/vehicle/replace-color2.jpg)

1. Set the tolerance and other settings as needed to replace more or less of the initial color you click on. 
1. Click on a color in the image you want to replace, hold down the mouse/tablet pen, and paint! It will paint with the new color over the first color selected as long as you don't unclick.

## Extend the Base

To add new pieces to the vehicle, cut out model bits and add them to the image. You may need to reshape, scale, distort, and warp the pieces to fit nicely together. Or you may need to cobble together many bits and pieces, creating a Frankenstein image!

For this wing, it needed to be pointed away from the hull without affecting the phoenix head.

1. Cut a piece from a model. If I plan on resizing only a part of it, create a copy of all or a section.

1. Use **Edit** > **Free Transform** and Transform Tools to shift, move, and tweak the model to fit just right. Other tools to consider are Perspective Grid and Liquify, excellent for shifting bits and pieces.
1. Cut away the head which will be replaced with the original.
1. Move the head back in, and make any final tweaks.
1. If you need to enhance the image, click **Filter** > **Sharpen** > **Unsharp Mask** and try out some options.
