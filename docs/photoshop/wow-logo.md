Create your own WoW Logos for events, campaigns, and guilds! Using the base logo images from World of Warcraft, these Photoshop files give you the ability to add art and text, generating custom logos for your groups.

There are two versions:

* Large base logos
* Medium logos with space for your [guild crests](crest.md)
