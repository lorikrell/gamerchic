*"Hear ye! Hear ye! The great Warlord of Scarlet Bones, Regent of the Sundered Kingdoms, demands you open wide the gates! Send forth your leaders to swear fealty or suffer!" The herald spoke rightly as the masses of warriors, cavalry, and archers prepared to lay siege upon the small city. Yet when the heroes spied out details to take to their leaders, they saw...*

Good question! Would this warlord wave an umbrella plucked from your favorite bar drink as a hasty symbol for the warlord? Or would it be a regal flowing of banners and chains, cracked skulls clanking in the breeze, with their standard colors and symbol beaming for all to see?

Create custom banners for your world, characters, guilds, armies, adventuring parties, enemies, and more with this Photoshop file. It includes 6 banner styles with variations, colors, top and back decorations, and icons! These icons are for World of Warcraft, but you can drop any transparent icon or symbol in the file to automatically style. Click to show and hide options. For the hologram, you can change all of the colors of glows to match the banner color.
