description: Free avatar template for RPGs, VTTs, Warcraft, and more.

You enter the domain of the lich through twisting passages. As you traverse, you wander the in game halls of a raid building like Karazhan or a beautiful map in a VTT like Roll20. Then the mastermind of months of roleplay and events appears... a floating X. Kind of anti-climatic. What if you could have a piece of art in a nice round frame to post in Discord or reveal in Roll20?!

This avatar template (.PSD) gives you the power to add art, select a ring border, and select all sorts of effects to make it look incredible: metal embossed laurels and skulls, glowing rune rings, shadows and flames, simple thin rings.
