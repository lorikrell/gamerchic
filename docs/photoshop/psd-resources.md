Graphics can bring life to a table top game, VTT run virtual game, Warcraft campaign, and other types of events. These resources include the following file types to quickly craft unique graphics:

* Photoshop files ![PSD](/img/psd.png) for coins, wax seals, event cards, Discord banners, and more
* Google Slides for journals, scrolls, letters, and maps

## Image Editors

Photoshop .PSD files can be opened and edited in any art application that opens .PSD. Some of the most popular and recommended are Photoshop, Affinity Designer, and [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) online editor (Free). The files may include layer effects for text, drop shadows, bevel and embossing that will break with applications like GIMP, PaintToolSai, and Clip Studio Paint.

## Fonts

This is a collection of fonts I use in the PSD resources on this site. Download and install fonts to your local. You can also add these to Photopea online!
