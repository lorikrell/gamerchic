Brighten your Discord with custom Warcraft emojis and stickers, all from one pack! This series is drawn by me, Sonceri of Moon Guard US server/[lorioliodraws](https://twitter.com/lorioliodraws) on Twitter. Each file is a square 400x400px, capable of being added as a sticker or emoji to your Discord server.

Additional options are available to [my Patreons](https://www.patreon.com/sonceri).
