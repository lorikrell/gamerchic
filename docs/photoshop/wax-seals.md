Wax seals include round and square formats with numerous patterns and colors including metal and stone. Use these to create custom seals for using your your letters, journals, and much more.

You can create these for D&D, Pathfinder, LARPs, World of Darkness, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, homebrew settings, thief guilds, noble families, and many other games and genres.

:::sonceri Photoshop and Photopea
These templates use layer effects, masks, and clipping masks to generate seals.You can use Photoshop and [Photopea free online](https://www.photopea.com/) editor. Versions for Clip Studio, GIMP, and other graphic programs are not available yet due to some limitations. These were created using the latest Photoshop Creative Cloud version.

:::sonceri Fonts and Brushes
If you want to add special effects, add text, or grunge up the seals, download and install fonts and brushes. See [Fonts and Brushes](psd-resources.md).

## Download PSD Files

You have more options for making wax seals! You will need to supply your own icons for the new files. The Original seals file does have some icons already available.

Each file includes:

* A top level instruction layer to get you started
* A location to save your icons
* Metal touches to highlight your icon
* Multiple shapes for the seal
* Numerous options for a simple color or patterns, colors, and effects to create brilliant seals

:::warning Large Files
These files can be rather large, some of them ~200mb, due to the hefty amount of shapes and overlay colors. I tried to make these smaller, and group seal shapes into specific files.

## Get an Icon

Before creating a seal, you will need an icon, clipart, or symbol. This should have a transparent background.

Where to find a symbol?

* Search for free lineart or clipart. Check icon libraries like [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/), FontAwesome, or Material.
* Draw your own lineart. Just make sure it is on a transparent background.
* Use free heraldry images for flags and house crests. There are many sites and libraries, like [HeraldryClipart](http://www.heraldicclipart.com/catalog/index1.html)
* Search for vintage designs and decorations like art nouveau or art deco designs.

You can add one or many different icons to make up your seal!

## Create a Seal

It's time to create your wax seal. These instructions will use the new round seals, and can be used for any file:

1. Open one of the seals files. They are all set up exactly the same. The first layer is an instruction to get started.

    ![Wax Seals](/img/resources/wow-seal1.jpg)

1. Expand the ICON and METAL group folder. The first options are a bunch of metals. Just show/hide 1 metal layer! This will lay over your icon. Then copy and paste your icon into the ADD ICON HERE folder.

    ![Wax Seals](/img/resources/wow-seal2.jpg)

    :::sonceri About Foils
    Metal effects can really highlight your icon. But if you don't want one, that's ok! You can hide all of those layers. Just make sure the icon you paste in is fully black in color.
    :::

1. Show 1 seal folder. Hide the others. This is the seal you will make. Then expand the PICK COLORS folder. You can browse through the folders and options, showing and hiding patterns and colors. These layers are like stacking transparencies, so they will show through to the next. For best results, only have 1 showing. But you can try many! 

    Each folder has options to choose from. This example shows three examples: just a Base Color of red, an image from the Black folder, and an option from Mixed.

    ![Wax Seals](/img/resources/wow-seal3.jpg)

    :::sonceri Add new patterns!
    You can also add your own! Find a pattern you like, copy and paste it into those layer groups. Change the layer style from Normal to options like Multiply, Screen, Lighten, and so on till you find a look you like. It will automatically mask to fill just the wax seal.
    :::

1. For **ROUND** seals, you have options for additional rings for the wax art and designs to show under the seal including golden leaves and filigree and magic circles. Show and hide the under options in UNDER DESIGNS and RUNE CIRCLES.

1. Save as a *.png*. Click File > Export > Quick Export as a PNG. You can upload the image to Discord, Google docs, art galleries like Imgur, and much more!
