## Kal'dorei

Ancient in sight, keen of mind, caught between the measure of nature and faith of mother moon, the Kal'dorei suffer forward after a terrifying flame sought to engulf their entire people. They rise eternal as does the moon, hidden in turnings, shining in others, never forgotten or lost.

This journal holds a sight of Elune's prayerful chambers upon fine parchment pressed from lavender and peacebloom. The light of mother moon shimmers in the binding. Bookmarks include a lovely butterfly harpy and a lady draped in lilies holding a pearl set on blue velvet ribbon.

![Night Elf](/img/journal/journal-nightelf.jpg)

## Sin'dorei

Proud savagery of politics, magics, and war, the Sin'dorei bring a cultivated civilization to their roughened world. Children of the Blood, they have weathered numerous wars, obstacles born of fallen leaders, armies of undead, and invasion of demons. Yet ever shall their sunlit souls brave forward and battle back the dark.

This journal holds a sight of Silvermoon city upon fine parchment pressed from firebloom and mana thistle. The flame of the Sunwell shimmers in the binding. Bookmarks include a lovely phoenix set with pearl, a portrait in emerald on olive velvet ribbon, and a finery of dripping rubies.

![Blood Elf](/img/journal/journal-bloodelf.jpg)

## Shal'dorei

Lost elders returned from a life in careful exile, the Nightborn rejoin the world they witnessed in its infancy. They slivered in twain from the Kal'dorei when their worlds teetered on the verge of destruction, crafting a nightwell of power. A stream that became a trickle to keep all bound. The bounds no longer hold bringing their ancient wisdom among their brethren.

This journal holds a sight of the arcan'dor upon fine parchment pressed from astral glory and dreamleaf. The gleam of Nightborn runes burn in the binding. Bookmarks include mithril flowers, runemark inlaid with tigereye and arcane, and a finery of dripping amethyst.

![Suramar Elf](/img/journal/journal-nightborn.jpg)

## Quel'dorei

Born of heritages that hold true to their path, descended from many yet singular in faith and vision, the Quel'dorei are the high elven. Against all odds, they survive this age with a promise for the next, remembering what has been to temper what shall be.

This journal holds a sight of highborn towers upon fine parchment pressed from mountain silversage and sungrass. The gleam of light caught between night and morn glimmers in the binding. Bookmarks include a lovely butterfly harpy, runemark inlaid with tigereye and arcane, and a finery of lapis lazuli flowers in gold filigree.

![High Elf](/img/journal/journal-highelf.jpg)

## Ren'dorei

The velvet void granted an understanding beyond worlds, life, and death. Theirs is a path few understand, bounding betwixt the rift and the shadow, though not one cast by other light. The ways between and all the power it holds. This twisting power may usher a new life for the elven, if they have the enlightenment to witness the Void.

This journal holds a sight of the unending void caught between riftways upon fine parchment pressed from black and purple lotus. A mote pulsing with void hums within the binding. Bookmarks include mithril flowers, runemark consumed by void, and a finery once from Silvermoon imbued with crackling tendrils of void.

![Void Elf](/img/journal/journal-voidelf.jpg)

## Fel-bound

Illidari take up the mantle of demon hunters, burning away their sight and lives for a new one. Other fel-bound may have walked the path of warlocks, coming too close to servitude or the twisting nether. Others may have imbibed too deeply of fel-magics for one reason or another.

This journal holds a sight of grand fel towers beholden of the Cathedral of Night from the Broken Isles upon fine parchment pressed from felweed and netherbloom. Fel energies cascade from a hidden rune within the binding. Bookmarks include death marks of corroded fel iron gleaming with imbued emerald eyes.

![Fel Elf](/img/journal/journal-illidari.jpg)

## San'layn

Blood is the life! It courses down their throat, opening doorways of the mind and lengthening the body. The path of the remade, they harken to the drumbeat of living hearts and the everdark of night.

This journal holds a sight of ancient spires risen before a blood moon seething in scarlet glow upon fine parchment pressed from nightmare vine and talandra's rose. Chilled blood hazes about a filled sanguine vial in the binding. Bookmarks include death marks of dark iron gleaming with imbued ruby eyes and a star of crystalized blood.

![Vampire Elf](/img/journal/journal-sanlayn.jpg)

## Death Knight

Felled by blades, risen to serve, now broken free of tethers. They stalk through this new unlife, a warrior of frost, disease, and blood. None shall dictate their way forward, regardless of the past. 

This journal holds a sight of crypts deep within the cavernous holds of long dead breathren upon fine parchment pressed from lichbloom and starflower. A soul's fire burns ever-caught in the binding. Bookmarks include death marks of saronite gleaming with imbued sapphire eyes, a dark iron filigree heart holding a blood amethyst, and a momento of a life before.
