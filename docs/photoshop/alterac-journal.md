Beyond the green forests of Hillsbrad and crater of Dalaran lies the frozen climes of the Alterac Mountains. In the valleys of dense forests and dark snowy rock, the hearty folk of the Stormpike and Frost Wolves keep vigil. Recent warfare led adventurers into these windswept mountains. And this journal can hold those details.
