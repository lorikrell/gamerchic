From the mountains, hills, and wide world, the dwarven folk hold true to a craftsman's spirit and will of mithril. To chart the life and times of our stone heralded brethren, this journal provides a series of metal and parchment pages sparked by their ancient ways. Runes, coins, seals, and more highlight the captured histories you document.
