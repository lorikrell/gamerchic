![Spy](/img/guides/guide-hidden.png)

*The silent care of soft footfalls amid leaves as the hooded eyes seek any sign of alert within an enemy camp. A calm mind directing many shadows down corridors of a lord's stronghold to find plans of a morning attack. The gurgled end of a target caught in a garrote as a pair of assassins steel away after completing their mission. The disguised servant moving to the memorized schedule of a household during a party to claim information and follow a mark. A group working on a plan to infiltrate and steal all the treasure from a fallen fortress or guarded sanctum.*

To move in stealth and spy upon quarry does not always require a rogue and thief's kit. Infiltration missions range the spectrum including disguised guests at a party, spies working for liberation as a double or triple agent, mercenary ops using brutal force to get in and out, treasure thieves running a heist, and...the usual movement of thieves using stealth and guile to complete a mission without leaving evidence of their movements. Building and running these missions can be diverse as any other event if you give it thought and care.

The target of spy and thief-craft also differs depending on the goals of a campaign. From eliminating targets to collecting information and supplies, a single agent or group of allies can turn the tide without alerting your enemies. This guide enters the world of spies, assassins, and thieves to give you the elements and guidelines for crafting remarkable events.

This guide can be used for MMO-RPG in-game events, tabletop games, LARPs, and more! The rolling rules are for a d20 system, but you could easily convert this to a d10 World of Darkness table of successes and botches, d6 Shadowrun system, and so on.

## What makes a good spy or stealth mission?

Before delving into the world of spies, let's consider the elements of a good stealth assignment.

The typical path of sneak in, kill the guy, and grab the loot is tried and trusted, but lacks imagination. To breath life into the genre, consider another option: player agency with consequences. The power of a fine spy/thief tale lies not in moving from point A to B and collecting C with high rolls for success. It's having an objective, setting the opportunities and pitfalls, and letting your players loose within the boundaries. 

Have lists and ideas ready for anything including rich NPCs, false leads, difficult claimed information (cursed, in code, broken), and constantly moving enemies. While players shift and move through a place, have your NPCs likewise on the move, open to changing sides, or steadfast to their cause. If the location or group being spied on would have a key villain, have them prominent, accessible, without being wooden. And have levels of consequences. One small failure should not cause the entire mission to fail, even at the end grab. Give the players a chance to rise and fall to the challenge.

:::sonceri To Battle or not to Battle?
The best spy and stealth events thrive within boundaries, sparking player ideas. An inventive one is the level of battle. If you remove warfare from the equation, tell your players early. Let them solve problems and end threats using the environment, NPCs, tools and equipment. If you want to use battle, consider instant kills and silencing manuevers. A dagger to the foot will earn screams whereas a dagger to the throat may silence that noise.

## Spycraft Building Blocks

The following are a few building blocks of story and mechanics to consider when creating spy vs assassin vs vault encounters.

<div id="hilit">

**Determine consequences for player actions.** Consider what happens if the players are uncovered or misstep. This can lead to an evolving story run by the players' actions through a series of plot steps you want to tackle. Think of it like a Rube Goldberg machine where every action causes another effect.

* Prepare before sneaking or just go? If they can collect information or start with some insights, that may give players bonuses to rolls or vital information on what they face. If they go in blind, hijinks can ensue.
* Fight their way out? Yes, but that has limited success. Players will need to hide the body or increase the kill/subdue count till they are free of alerts or out.
* Take prisoners? They could bind or knock out forces they invade, but other guards or leaders may wonder what happened to their people. Or the prisoners get loose and raise alarms.
* Disable or trip alarms? If they location has magic or mundane traps and alarms, can the players disarm or disable them? Or flip it around and set off every single alarm confusing their targets.
* If the mission fails, how do they get out? 
* If they succeed and have a hot/hunted item, what do they do with it?
* Does the employer double cross them? This scenario could be two rival teams seeking the same item. Or once receiving the objective, the employer tries to send the targets against the players.

**Keep action moving, but give them a breather.** Striking a balance betweem constant rushing through traps, tests, and a maze may be great for non-stop action. But to build the narrative and rising tension, give players safe zones to take a moment and consider their next moves. It could be a fortified location, a blind spot in a guard rotation, a shack on the premises. After a bit of time passes, give them incentive to move with perception tests around the location or through any watchful scouts in the team.

**Make the motive something the team wants to accomplish.** What are they seeking and why. These goals may include saving hostages, gaining wealth, gathering information, infiltrating an enemy, capturing a leader, and so on. Give hooks along the way that ensure the importance of the goal, perhaps pulling on player history or faction and political lines, to aid alliances, or forcing some moral quandries.

**Mix intelligent leaders with brutes.** A force running a con or holding a position are not all dumb and strong. They have intelligent leaders, specialists with different skills such as medicine, engineering, technology, ammunitions and explosives, and much more. Consider the skills of your players and creating a couple of mirrors for them in the enemy ranks. A sly bomb maker, a charismatic leader that once worked for the players' employer, and a medical doctor or healer can create deadly scenarios to foil the invading players.

**Encourage creative solutions.** Just telling your players to think about the situation may frustrate them when figuring out the best method to win. Add items, information, and opportunities to your location. A supply room with random items, broken technologies, pieces of bombs, and some old uniforms may spark players to create disguises, build a bomb, and interfere with communications.

**Rolls can be helpful.** If players get stuck, ask them to roll for a skill, expertise, intelligence or wisdom, perception, or just for ideas. Based on the results, toss ideas their way based on their characters, what's around them in the area, what's in their pockets or backpack. This little nudge may give them a chance to leap out of the bad situation, or create one for their enemy.

**Use alternate rules for silencing or assassinating targets.** For stealth missions, instead of running typical battles, consider assassination or subdue rolls to silence a target for a round. In that time, their comrades could bind hands and feet, stuff a rag in their mouths, or move them to a secure location. This reduces long fights with boring guards and focuses on more time dedicated to boss fights! Players then have memorable moments of knocking out five guards then epicly battling the general with two body guard hyenas instead of 2 hours fighting simple guards before a seemingly short leader fight.

**Make lists for failsafes, plan B, and other options for your enemies and players.** Nothing ever goes to plan with heists, scouting runs, and spy missions. By creating lists of key locations and options available at different times, you can react quickly to players without losing the pace and save you from hitting a deadlock moment. Depending on the situation, you could reward or curse players based on each situation won or lost by increasing or decreasing difficulties for the next actions, like earning a boon or incurring a tail on their route out.

## Building a Stealth/Spy Event

To build an entire horror campaign starts with smaller ideas, key villains, and arcing plots. Before coming up with a campaign, let's start with an initial event to start. For these steps, we will create two types of horror events: psychological horror and  splatterfest gore horror.

See [How to Run Events & Campaigns](best-practice.md) for information and the following tips:

* Give your spy/scouting event a theme. This can help hone in on objectives, resources, and opportunities for your players. For example, it could be the heist of the century, infiltrating a corrupt organization, or scouting a battlefield the night before the fight.
* Allow rolls to help suppliment roleplay. Whisper key information based on results, place items in their path, helping to put them on the right track.
* Provide NPCs and items that will have details to help. They may find or purchase plans to the location, get incorrect information on guard rotations, locate battle plans, or leave changes to orders to cause problems.
* Allow players to go different directions, keeping track of where they go and the consequences of those paths. Let them split their groups, find things out of order, and miss things.

### Set the Stage
Determine what the spy or stealth event is. This could be a couple sentences, which gives you something fantastic to give players when starting the event. Here are two examples used in this guide.

<div id="hilit">

**Lucky Aces Infiltration Team**: Answering the call, a group comes together under the name Lucky Aces. Each person takes a moniker based on a playing card. Enemy forces in a warring faction headquarters received another shipment of supplies and weapons, preparing to strike. The Aces will sneak into the compound, gather information, sabotage efforts, and save prisoners if any are found. They have sketchy information and part of a map. Stealth is key! How will they proceed?

| ![club](/img/icons/icon-club.png)<br/>Prisoners | A few prisoners may be kept shackled in the tents, along side any medics or other support staff. This position doesn't have a formal prison and may fall back to having important prisoners in the tower. |

| ![skull](/img/icons/icon-skull.png)<br/>Tower | The leader, knights, plans, seals, and other import items are kept in this solid structure. It's the most reinforced and defensible location. |

</div>

**Lost Arc of Jade Winds**: A beautiful arc of gold and jade was unearthed by a rival. It holds not just wealth but power, ancient scriptures and tomes of lore mark it as the vessel for archmagi relics of the ancient past. And we need it first. You need it before the rival opens and learns of that power. And payment? How about anything else you can find and lift from the vault? Gold, platnium, jewelry, fine artworks, weapons and armor...if they own one relic, they may have many more!

### Set Key Factors
When you plan a scouting/spy mission or a heist, give yourself key information to fall back on.

* **What are the possible objectives?** Spy and scouting missions may focus on learning numbers and positions of the enemy, a leader, supplies to capture, prisoners to save, plans and documents to collect, and more. Give objectives a location, protections, methods to find it, and DCs for any skill checks.
* **What are the entrances and exits to the location?** Make note of gates, doors, hatches, windows, and more and how they can get around or through them. Players can get inventive on how they break through walls, floors, windows, chimneys, and other potential points.
* **Who and what guards the objective?** Create a list of guards of people and creatures that patrol or guard the area. Note their paths, key locations, number of members and strength, and more.
* **What are the protections and traps?** Make note of siege weapons, turrets, weapon depots, traps and triggers, magical traps, wards, and other protective options at the location.
* What are

| | Lucky Aces Infiltration | Lost Arc Heist |

### Set a Difficulty Class
This is the difficult (DC) required on a roll or roleplay to complete a task or get info. You can set a DC for both quite easily and effectively, just to give context of finding or missing things. Consider awarding not only successes but failures, these could be painful finds, breaking evidence by finding it, or discovering incorrect details to increase tension or misdirect.

#### DC for Roleplay Events

For roleplayed freeform difficulties, you do not judge a roll result but keep a keen watch on position, path, described focus, and actions. For investigations, use the set locations to have players divide up and search.

Read through their text and provide information based on their attention to detail:

1. Set areas they can search (icons used as examples).
1. Watch their roleplay actions and details.
1. Provide insights only based on their details, giving them more to check or considerations to make. 
1. Consider their class, backstory, present interests when deciding what they find. Someone distraught may miss details, overzealous players may find a ton of details (some real, some false), a magic user may focus on arcane clues while a warrior checks the killing blow.
1. Don’t feel obligated to give all the details simply because they said they searched where you indicated. Have them work for it, interact, and come to conclusions. Provide incentive through the environment, a sense they believe they are correct, and outside force or NPC agreeing. 
1. If they fail to find the correct clues, don't force the information or punish them for missing it. Provide hooks into the next areas and scenes that point back to it or have it be a detriment later. Sometimes a failure is just as telling, and can muddy up a scene adding depth.

Example for a roleplay investigation of the Forest Trail:

<div class="info-rows">

| | |
| -- | -- |
| ![cross](/img/icons/icon-arrows.png) | Trees and bushes have been dug up and moved from here, leaving open holes in the earth and newly planted seedlings. It aids in moving cover for spying scouts to wait.<br/>Some trees have been pulled over, branches tied, to form a hiding place for spies to lie in wait.<br/>Marks from animals are old, having left this area some time ago. But fresh claw marks mark higher branches, from owls the spies of the elves. |
| ![star](/img/icons/icon-star.png) | The mounds of earth and undergrowth hold a sense of druidic magic. It seethes with a glow that reaches to branches and vines.<br/>You have faced warfare in these woods before, and the shadows of the trees hold a threat, perfect place for an ambush...<br/>As you near, a trap of entangling roots and vines awaits to unleash! |
| ![square](/img/icons/icon-diamond.png) | A sickly sweet scent of death and blossoms rises from the underbrush, definitely from a larger body not some small animals.<br/>Flies buzz, a sign of fresh death, while the scent of decay seems older. Brushing back leaves, you spy two bodies wrapped in entangling roots. Both hold the marks of allies.<br/>The bodies have died from one of many methods. Strangled by vines. Sucked dry by roots. Poisoned by flowers. They are not slashed, stabbed, or pierced by weapons.  |

</div>

#### DC for Rolling Events
These games you roll to get a result. Usually 1-20 or d20 die with 1 being a critical failure and 20 a critical success. If you use custom game rules for MMOs or tabletop systems, bonuses may be added on rolls to go beyond a 20 or to reroll. Also what they roll differs for these situations.

* Tabletop System: As noted previously, this could be any system using dice. Convert table results as needed, roll DC vs number of successes, etc. This uses a d20 system.
* Homebrew: Use special rolls set by group, guild, or your own
* [Champion’s Compendium](https://burlycloud.wixsite.com/champion/traits): Traits rolls, items can influence results
* [Warcraft Conquest Simplified 1.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XxboiKSuBA1UsGZfuCWi7EJ_YxYxzptIk-eCJjuLQWE/preview): Perception or Expertise rolls, Perceptive +5

For all of these systems, you have control to set the DC and what players learn. Here are recommendations with examples from the Death of Lord Ferris:

| Roll | Results | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | *Critical Failure.* Consider finding and destroying evidence, misdirecting unrelated evidence, or a curve ball. | You take care looking over the body, considering the scene. As you step back, you trip over a chair, spin away from the desk, and fall into a wall...that opens to a hidden tunnel! |
| 2-9 | *Failure.* They may not find incredible details, but you can give them additional information based on what they check. | The dagger is stabbed through the back, between the shoulder blades. Definitely a killing blow. |
| 10-14 | *Success.* Provide additional details that could lead to further investigations. | The dagger has a house symbol you know is a rival of the victim. You know some members of that rival house are visiting the party. If one of them is missing a blade...? |
| 15-19 | *Great Success.* Provide detailed information regarding the investigation, strong evidence that could lead to  | The wound should have far more blood than it does. The rug is doused in wine, not blood. You don't see any cups or goblets, but there is a bottle half empty. |
| 20+ | *Critical Success.* Provide finer points that are rare and difficult to find. | The wine soaked rug has a slight scent of poison, some of th frayed threads are burned from the acrid contents. It's potent! |

### Set the Scene

I strongly recommend prewriting a few things that may be lengthy. This cuts down on waiting for responses and keeps the event moving forward. Here are examples:

* Description of the scene: What they see, what’s available to investigate, consider all of the senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste).
* What can be investigated: One line with a raid marker in text detailing what is there to check.
* DC responses: Set up your DC and results, keep these short, you can expand on them as you like while in game to make it special.
* Questioning staff: What if they want to question a servant? If you would like active interaction, add a servant and give them some lines to provide.

Connect your content with the physical location. Add raid markers per area they can investigate. This helps you track what players are checking, connecting to your DC rolls and descriptions. To make your life easier, take screenshots and create images plotting your raid markers. If you don’t have a chance to set them with another player, use screenshots and Google Drawing. Here is an example:

![Ferris Markers](/img/guides/trail-house-markers.jpg)

*Map by [Natwuns](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/k47y0s/battlemap_enchanted_library_37x228498x7565px2/)!*

<div class="info-rows">

| | |
| -- | -- |
| ![cross](/img/icons/icon-club.png)<br/>Bookcases | Books tumble from the shelves, spilling across the floor, tossed back and forth from their places. Loose parchment juts from books, between stacks, yanked free from bindings. Someone hunted madly for a page, something tucked in a book or hidden behind the stacks. |
| ![square](/img/icons/icon-skull.png)<br/>Body | Lord Ferris lies dead, one arm outstretched with the other curled underneath. His robes tightly wind around his body, legs caught yet in jagged angles as if running when stabbed or...something else. His eyes stare wide, bulging from the sockets, lips parched, jaw clenched tight. Blood and wine stains his jaw. A dagger portrudes from his back. |
| ![circle](/img/icons/icon-diamond.png)<br/>Rug/Wine | A thick rug of hand-woven soft yarn shifts in shades of scarlet, gold, and emerald with lines of onyx depicting a house seal, floating above arches, grand designs. Wine soaks through the artwork, spreading forth as if seeking to cover the house symbol. The body covers most of the designwork. An empty scrollcase has rolled from the body to rest in the wine stain. |
| ![triangle](/img/icons/icon-moon.png)<br/>Desk | A fine desk of rosewood and inlaid ivory is a mess of shuffled papers, spilled inks, ripped open letters and mail. Drawers have been pulled open, contents searched. One remains locked despite the marred marked of someone trying to force it open. |

</div>

## Run the Event

Much like a battle, these events will have a beginning and finale. Investigations may have multiple scenes and locations, one leading to the next. You can follow these examples for each transition, giving players more to investigate and connect until they reach the final encounter.

<div id="hilit">

**Connect environmental rolls and situations to solve.** You can definitely mix battle and environmental obstacles in your investigation, the same as you can add investigation scenes into a battle event. 

* For the library, they may have someone become sick from the wine if taste-tested, magic wards could flare, the dagger could be cursed if pulled from the body. 
* For the trail, the entangling roots trap could be triggered, attempting to catch one or more players to strangle and poison, a sapling could suddenly grow and attack as a forest protector.

**Connect your clues when moving scenes.** Players will use the clues to build their case and seek answers. Give them NPCs with information if asked. Consider giving studied results by magic, alchemy, battle knowledge, history, and other knowledges and skills. 

* For the library, the dagger may have been taken from a rival noble without their knowing, a goblet with the same poison found at the dinner table with a different color, a scroll of special paper radiating magic in a servant's pocket. 
* For the trail, a sample of cut root leads down a path of matching druidic magics and marks, a rush of footprints of large cats rush through the forest just ahead matching those found at the trail, new sapplings pop out to fight just like those at the trail.

**Consider failures and misdirection clues to false accusations but new solutions.** Perhaps some of the clues learned and investigated that were incurred due to a critical failure cause incorrect assumptions. This can add depth or force the hand of the real culprit, turning a negative into a positive. 

* For the library, the rival noble had nothing to do with the death and could provide insights on the poison, the hidden passage leads to a servant's room and another dead body...maybe the servant you see if polymorphed!
* For the trail, the large cat's prints are not an enemy but potential ally, as you see a tauren druid battling for their life in entangling roots, having only moment's to live!
