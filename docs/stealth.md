![Spy](/img/guides/guide-hidden.png)

*The silent care of soft footfalls amid leaves as the hooded eyes seek any sign of alert within an enemy camp. A calm mind directing many shadows down corridors of a lord's stronghold to find plans of a morning attack. The gurgled end of a target caught in a garrote as a pair of assassins steel away after completing their mission. The disguised servant moving to the memorized schedule of a household during a party to claim information and follow a mark. A group working on a plan to infiltrate and steal all the treasure from a fallen fortress or guarded sanctum.*

To move in stealth and spy upon quarry does not always require a rogue and thief's kit. Infiltration missions range the spectrum including disguised guests at a party, spies working for liberation as a double or triple agent, mercenary ops using brutal force to get in and out, treasure thieves running a heist, and...the usual movement of thieves using stealth and guile to complete a mission without leaving evidence of their movements. Building and running these missions can be diverse as any other event if you give it thought and care.

The target of spy and thief-craft also differs depending on the goals of a campaign. From eliminating targets to collecting information and supplies, a single agent or group of allies can turn the tide without alerting your enemies. This guide enters the world of spies, assassins, and thieves to give you the elements and guidelines for crafting remarkable events.

This guide can be used for MMO-RPG in-game events, tabletop games, LARPs, and more! The rolling rules are for a d20 system, but you could easily convert this to a d10 World of Darkness table of successes and botches, d6 Shadowrun system, and so on.

## What makes a good spy or stealth mission?

Before delving into the world of spies, let's consider the elements of a good stealth assignment.

The typical path of sneak in, kill the guy, and grab the loot is tried and trusted, but lacks imagination. To breath life into the genre, consider another option: player agency with consequences. The power of a fine spy/thief tale lies not in moving from point A to B and collecting C with high rolls for success. It's having an objective, setting the opportunities and pitfalls, and letting your players loose within the boundaries. 

Have lists and ideas ready for anything including rich NPCs, false leads, difficult claimed information (cursed, in code, broken), and constantly moving enemies. While players shift and move through a place, have your NPCs likewise on the move, open to changing sides, or steadfast to their cause. If the location or group being spied on would have a key villain, have them prominent, accessible, without being wooden. And have levels of consequences. One small failure should not cause the entire mission to fail, even at the end grab. Give the players a chance to rise and fall to the challenge.

:::sonceri To Battle or not to Battle?
The best spy and stealth events thrive within boundaries, sparking player ideas. An inventive one is the level of battle. If you remove warfare from the equation, tell your players early. Let them solve problems and end threats using the environment, NPCs, tools and equipment. If you want to use battle, consider instant kills and silencing manuevers. A dagger to the foot will earn screams whereas a dagger to the throat may silence that noise.

## Building a Stealth/Spy Event

To build an entire horror campaign starts with smaller ideas, key villains, and arcing plots. Before coming up with a campaign, let's start with an initial event to start. For these steps, we will create two types of horror events: psychological horror and  splatterfest gore horror.

See [How to Run Events & Campaigns](best-practice.md) for information and the following tips:

* Give your event and horror a theme. This can help you form ideas and give your players expectations. For example: ravaged by a curse, haunted mansion, rise of the dead, ritual gone bad, becoming a lich, death knights breaking from service, the fallen rightous, monster attacks, stolen artifact of a major power, murderous designs.
* If the evil can be ended, have multiple methods for players to learn what is needed, materials/weapons/prayers to end the threat, NPCs to aid in resolving issues, and other ideas for conflict. If you tie everything to one or two places and items, they may not catch on and miss opportunities.
* Provide NPCs and items that will have details to help, some may not know what they have or found, some may demand payment for the information. This can also be an interesting hook for a fight, learning the past, determining weaknesses, creating a solution, and so on.
* Consider asking your players for backstory information or some of their fears. You can use these pieces to enhance and personalize the dark aspects touching on their personal story.
* Create a map to track your horror story. Here is an [example for horror events](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1gbPCHeGB-qnfxWzix4Aq_N9KrpClYdYJWDJpt_Rlc0I/edit), MMO Warcraft and tabletop.


### Set the Stage
Determine what the horror event is. This could be a couple sentences, which gives you something fantastic to give players when starting the event.

<div id="hilit">

* **Lucky Aces Infiltration Team**: Answering the call, a group comes together under the name Lucky Aces. Each person takes a moniker based on a playing card. Enemy forces in a warring faction headquarters received another shipment of supplies and weapon, preparing to strike. The Aces will sneak into a compound, gather information, sabotage efforts, and save prisoners if any are found. They have sketchy information and part of a map. Stealth is key! How will they proceed?

* **Lost Arc of Jade Winds**: A beautiful arc of gold and jade was unearthed by a rival. It holds not just wealth but power, ancient scriptures and tomes of lore mark it as the vessel for archmagi relics of the ancient past. And we need it first. You need it before the rival opens and learns of that power. And payment? How about anything else you can find and lift from the vault? Gold, platnium, jewelry, fine artworks, weapons and armor...if they own one relic, they may have many more!

### Set Key Factors
When you have a scene coming up that may incur investigations, give yourself key information to fall back on.

* What can they investigate? Give them key areas and directions or you will be there for hours sifting through meaningless details.
* What clues lead from this item/situation? Consider minor to major, directly connected to the object of investigation/the culprits or loosely affiliated to the actual scene.
* Who or what is connected to the item/situation? What are the motivations?

| | Dead Lord Ferris | Forest Trail at Camp |
| -- | -- | -- |
| What can they investigate? | <ul><li>Dead body & pockets</li><li>Weapon in back</li><li>Empty scroll case on body</li><li>Trashed desk</li><li>Trashed bookcase</li><li>Beautiful rug body is on</li></ul> | <ul><li>The trail and surrounding dirt and grass</li><li>Nearby trees and bushes</li><li>Odd hollows and mounds in the ground</li></ul> |
|Clues from the area? | <ul><li>The dagger in the back has a house symbol</li><li>The scrollcase is lead lined and empty, whatever in it taken</li><li>His clothing is disheveled, wine spattered, little blood, with a ripped coat where the scrollcase was</li><li>The trashed desk and bookcase marks someone searching for something - finding it in the scrollcase</li><li>The rug is seeped through with wine, very little blood, no goblet or glass is there</li></ul> | <ul><li>The trail is old, little more than a game path through the trees, but the area has a bit more growth than it should</li><li>A bush or two has been moved, holes dug and bushes from nearby moved closer to the camp</li><li>Some branches have been snapped/cut to view different parts of the camp from afar</li><li>Sound of flies, smell rich decay of fresh dead</li><li>Marks of scouts kneeling, casing the camp, footprints away leaving all recent</li></ul> |
| Connection & motivation? | <ul><li>Dagger is from a rival house of the dead body and that the players are visiting</li><li>The dagger is a red herring, false evidence, the death is from poison (spilled wine)</li><li>The poisoned goblet is missing, easy to pocket (could use to find the killer)</li><li>The lead in the scrollcase blocked location magic for the item (magic scroll, letter)</li></ul> | <ul><li>Scouts may know the trail leads to an old cave</li><li>Footprints are fresh and head down the trail (cave)</li><li>Some footprints may diverge into the woods (ambush)</li><li>Enemies will return, didn’t leave cause of patrol</li><li>Dead body could be scout, prisoner, missing group member, etc</li></ul> |

### Set a Difficulty Class
This is the difficult (DC) required on a roll or roleplay to complete a task or get info. You can set a DC for both quite easily and effectively, just to give context of finding or missing things. Consider awarding not only successes but failures, these could be painful finds, breaking evidence by finding it, or discovering incorrect details to increase tension or misdirect.

#### DC for Roleplay Events

For roleplayed freeform difficulties, you do not judge a roll result but keep a keen watch on position, path, described focus, and actions. For investigations, use the set locations to have players divide up and search.

Read through their text and provide information based on their attention to detail:

1. Set areas they can search (icons used as examples).
1. Watch their roleplay actions and details.
1. Provide insights only based on their details, giving them more to check or considerations to make. 
1. Consider their class, backstory, present interests when deciding what they find. Someone distraught may miss details, overzealous players may find a ton of details (some real, some false), a magic user may focus on arcane clues while a warrior checks the killing blow.
1. Don’t feel obligated to give all the details simply because they said they searched where you indicated. Have them work for it, interact, and come to conclusions. Provide incentive through the environment, a sense they believe they are correct, and outside force or NPC agreeing. 
1. If they fail to find the correct clues, don't force the information or punish them for missing it. Provide hooks into the next areas and scenes that point back to it or have it be a detriment later. Sometimes a failure is just as telling, and can muddy up a scene adding depth.

Example for a roleplay investigation of the Forest Trail:

<div class="info-rows">

| | |
| -- | -- |
| ![cross](/img/icons/icon-arrows.png) | Trees and bushes have been dug up and moved from here, leaving open holes in the earth and newly planted seedlings. It aids in moving cover for spying scouts to wait.<br/>Some trees have been pulled over, branches tied, to form a hiding place for spies to lie in wait.<br/>Marks from animals are old, having left this area some time ago. But fresh claw marks mark higher branches, from owls the spies of the elves. |
| ![star](/img/icons/icon-star.png) | The mounds of earth and undergrowth hold a sense of druidic magic. It seethes with a glow that reaches to branches and vines.<br/>You have faced warfare in these woods before, and the shadows of the trees hold a threat, perfect place for an ambush...<br/>As you near, a trap of entangling roots and vines awaits to unleash! |
| ![square](/img/icons/icon-diamond.png) | A sickly sweet scent of death and blossoms rises from the underbrush, definitely from a larger body not some small animals.<br/>Flies buzz, a sign of fresh death, while the scent of decay seems older. Brushing back leaves, you spy two bodies wrapped in entangling roots. Both hold the marks of allies.<br/>The bodies have died from one of many methods. Strangled by vines. Sucked dry by roots. Poisoned by flowers. They are not slashed, stabbed, or pierced by weapons.  |

#### DC for Rolling Events
These games you roll to get a result. Usually 1-20 or d20 die with 1 being a critical failure and 20 a critical success. If you use custom game rules for MMOs or tabletop systems, bonuses may be added on rolls to go beyond a 20 or to reroll. Also what they roll differs for these situations.

* Tabletop System: As noted previously, this could be any system using dice. Convert table results as needed, roll DC vs number of successes, etc. This uses a d20 system.
* Homebrew: Use special rolls set by group, guild, or your own
* [Champion’s Compendium](https://burlycloud.wixsite.com/champion/traits): Traits rolls, items can influence results
* [Warcraft Conquest Simplified 1.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XxboiKSuBA1UsGZfuCWi7EJ_YxYxzptIk-eCJjuLQWE/preview): Perception or Expertise rolls, Perceptive +5

For all of these systems, you have control to set the DC and what players learn. Here are recommendations with examples from the Death of Lord Ferris:

| Roll | Results | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | *Critical Failure.* Consider finding and destroying evidence, misdirecting unrelated evidence, or a curve ball. | You take care looking over the body, considering the scene. As you step back, you trip over a chair, spin away from the desk, and fall into a wall...that opens to a hidden tunnel! |
| 2-9 | *Failure.* They may not find incredible details, but you can give them additional information based on what they check. | The dagger is stabbed through the back, between the shoulder blades. Definitely a killing blow. |
| 10-14 | *Success.* Provide additional details that could lead to further investigations. | The dagger has a house symbol you know is a rival of the victim. You know some members of that rival house are visiting the party. If one of them is missing a blade...? |
| 15-19 | *Great Success.* Provide detailed information regarding the investigation, strong evidence that could lead to  | The wound should have far more blood than it does. The rug is doused in wine, not blood. You don't see any cups or goblets, but there is a bottle half empty. |
| 20+ | *Critical Success.* Provide finer points that are rare and difficult to find. | The wine soaked rug has a slight scent of poison, some of th frayed threads are burned from the acrid contents. It's potent! |

### Set the Scene

I strongly recommend prewriting a few things that may be lengthy. This cuts down on waiting for responses and keeps the event moving forward. Here are examples:

* Description of the scene: What they see, what’s available to investigate, consider all of the senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste).
* What can be investigated: One line with a raid marker in text detailing what is there to check.
* DC responses: Set up your DC and results, keep these short, you can expand on them as you like while in game to make it special.
* Questioning staff: What if they want to question a servant? If you would like active interaction, add a servant and give them some lines to provide.

Connect your content with the physical location. Add raid markers per area they can investigate. This helps you track what players are checking, connecting to your DC rolls and descriptions. To make your life easier, take screenshots and create images plotting your raid markers. If you don’t have a chance to set them with another player, use screenshots and Google Drawing. Here is an example:

![Ferris Markers](/img/guides/trail-house-markers.jpg)

*Map by [Natwuns](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/k47y0s/battlemap_enchanted_library_37x228498x7565px2/)!*

<div class="info-rows">

| | |
| -- | -- |
| ![cross](/img/icons/icon-club.png)<br/>Bookcases | Books tumble from the shelves, spilling across the floor, tossed back and forth from their places. Loose parchment juts from books, between stacks, yanked free from bindings. Someone hunted madly for a page, something tucked in a book or hidden behind the stacks. |
| ![square](/img/icons/icon-skull.png)<br/>Body | Lord Ferris lies dead, one arm outstretched with the other curled underneath. His robes tightly wind around his body, legs caught yet in jagged angles as if running when stabbed or...something else. His eyes stare wide, bulging from the sockets, lips parched, jaw clenched tight. Blood and wine stains his jaw. A dagger portrudes from his back. |
| ![circle](/img/icons/icon-diamond.png)<br/>Rug/Wine | A thick rug of hand-woven soft yarn shifts in shades of scarlet, gold, and emerald with lines of onyx depicting a house seal, floating above arches, grand designs. Wine soaks through the artwork, spreading forth as if seeking to cover the house symbol. The body covers most of the designwork. An empty scrollcase has rolled from the body to rest in the wine stain. |
| ![triangle](/img/icons/icon-moon.png)<br/>Desk | A fine desk of rosewood and inlaid ivory is a mess of shuffled papers, spilled inks, ripped open letters and mail. Drawers have been pulled open, contents searched. One remains locked despite the marred marked of someone trying to force it open. |

## Run the Event

Much like a battle, these events will have a beginning and finale. Investigations may have multiple scenes and locations, one leading to the next. You can follow these examples for each transition, giving players more to investigate and connect until they reach the final encounter.

<div id="hilit">

**Connect environmental rolls and situations to solve.** You can definitely mix battle and environmental obstacles in your investigation, the same as you can add investigation scenes into a battle event. 

* For the library, they may have someone become sick from the wine if taste-tested, magic wards could flare, the dagger could be cursed if pulled from the body. 
* For the trail, the entangling roots trap could be triggered, attempting to catch one or more players to strangle and poison, a sapling could suddenly grow and attack as a forest protector.

**Connect your clues when moving scenes.** Players will use the clues to build their case and seek answers. Give them NPCs with information if asked. Consider giving studied results by magic, alchemy, battle knowledge, history, and other knowledges and skills. 

* For the library, the dagger may have been taken from a rival noble without their knowing, a goblet with the same poison found at the dinner table with a different color, a scroll of special paper radiating magic in a servant's pocket. 
* For the trail, a sample of cut root leads down a path of matching druidic magics and marks, a rush of footprints of large cats rush through the forest just ahead matching those found at the trail, new sapplings pop out to fight just like those at the trail.

**Consider failures and misdirection clues to false accusations but new solutions.** Perhaps some of the clues learned and investigated that were incurred due to a critical failure cause incorrect assumptions. This can add depth or force the hand of the real culprit, turning a negative into a positive. 

* For the library, the rival noble had nothing to do with the death and could provide insights on the poison, the hidden passage leads to a servant's room and another dead body...maybe the servant you see if polymorphed!
* For the trail, the large cat's prints are not an enemy but potential ally, as you see a tauren druid battling for their life in entangling roots, having only moment's to live!
