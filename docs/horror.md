*Hundreds of birds flock into trees surrounding a property, watchful and silent as anyone nears the gates. All the buyers of a fine sword all seem to die within a year of owning it, killed by the blade. Your favorite fruit seller has gone missing and no one seems to remember them...only you. Members of your hunting party camp in the old stones of a fallen house, and wake to find matching symbols tattooed on each of your hands. Local fisherman speak of a lights on a small island in the lake, but none dare go near it. You and a group of strangers arrive to a tower in the mountains, invited by a lady few remember, inviting you all to a late dinner... Farmer Peters has the finest apples in the county and a terrifying scarecrow in the orchard wearing a familiar old cloak. Prayers to a new statue in the old church seem to come true, then turn sour.*

What is horror? A sense of fright, feeling off? A moment that strikes and earns a yelp of surprise? A rising tension that claims your breath and makes you want to run, yet you cannot move? An anger that consumes the senses and spurs a terrible need to destroy everything around you? A chilling silence and absence of...everything? 

Horror events and campaigns delve into not only the macabre (disturbing depictions of death and injury), but into situations and sensations that leave us uncomforatble. The genre highlights a series of situations with growing unease and complexity, even a slasher flick has a complicated backstory and splinter of true fear beyond brutal murder. This guide helps you find your way through creating and running these events. 

:::gamerchic Not a fan of horror?
Horror does not have to be overwhelming amounts of gore, terror, grandiose speeches, or Hellraiser levels of twisted themes. These events can lightly tough on aspects of horror, evoking a dark angle without giving YOU nightmares. If you have an event you have run before, and want to add a touch of darkness, give this a try following the guide. Slight tweaks to writing alone can shift a battle into chilling terror.

This guide can be used for World of Warcraft (WoW) in-game events, tabletop games, LARPs, and more! Some of the terminology may be geared to WoW or a d20 system, but anyone can use it for any genre. The rolling rules are for a d20 system, but you could easily convert this to a d10 World of Darkness table of successes and botches, d6 Shadowrun system, and so on.

## What makes a good horror tale?

Before plotting out terrifying scenes, let's consider the elements of a good horror story.
Dark events begin with normal circumstances and touches of something off-kilter, uncertain, or out-of-place. You build upon these elements, leading through the senses and mixing history and lore. Woven details. Rushing players through an area, mentioning something lurks in the dark, and ending in a sudden gory scene with exquisite details of dismemberment and lustful wrath is not quite horror. But giving the killer some backstory unearthed through discussions, investigations, and strange interactions touched with a series of incidents forwarning the inevitable definitely could frighten.

What frightens you and your players may differ greatly as these tales depend on subjective fear. Simply throwing a ton of blood and skulls in a room may not send the warrior half-orc running for the hills. A creepy noble sharing the same cat eyes as the feline settled in his lap may not concern an elven druid of the wild. There are methods to twist and turn these scenes to make those hardened folk quake.

Likewise, delving too far into horror can send players running or disturb them, not their characters. Driving players on a Cthulhu mythos journey of extreme details in madness, people carving each other up, gory ritual circles, without pausing to breath can end badly. Using too many real-world images and catastrophes, personal histories of players, or surgical levels of detail can sicken rather than disturb.  

> *Strike a balance in details, between gore and darkness, between realism and magic.*

:::sonceri Rate Your Event & Warn Your Players
When you run these events, always let your players know what they are in for! Not many players want extreme levels of horror, they may have nightmares or retch from descriptions. Consider giving your event a level of horror from 1 (light acts of evil) to 5 (Cthulhu is at the door) and a genre description. Some folks may run in terror away from a body horror event and arrive excited for a ghost story.

## Horror Building Blocks

The following are a few building blocks of story and mechanics to consider when creating investigations.

<div id="vhilit">

**Determine what haunts or hunts the story.** The story can include multiple facets of horror, but needs a clear focus for the core of it. Is it a villain, an object, a location, a person, history, magic, religion, and so on. 

**Decide on what kind of fear and horror you want to express.** This gives you a theme to work with. Here are some theme examples:

* *Gorefest*: A joyride through death like Mad Max Fury Road or Freddy in Nightmare on Elm Street. War, murder, deviltry all with a high death count can be the crux of horror. What would players to do stop it? What is driving the murder?
* *Psychological Horror*: Consider this type "hooked on a feeling". Pick an emotion and take it too far. How can love become twisted and torn? Perhaps the antagonist kills everyone in their path to gain the object of their desire, lying, killing, and capitalizing on situations. What would the villain need to commit for a perfect sense of peace? They may need to destroy all considered evil or mind control those that refuse to live by the rules.
* *Ghost Stories*: Look through all of the amazing supernatural ghosts available and craft a tale. Why does it remain, not contiuing to their afterlife? What will players need to resolve? 
* *Aberration Terror*: These are creatures from the beyond, cosmic horror, strange and alien concepts that cause madness. How do you dispel or return the evil? Who brought it and what keeps it here? How do you stop something summoned by cults or reawakened by accidental sacrifice in an old ruin, or released from magicial bonds.
* *Cursed Creations*: These are considered classic cult creatures including vampires, werewolves, and mummies. They have intelligence, a past. Are they tragic, long lived and hating it? Do they despise themselves and seek to spread the curse? Are they awakened by rituals and spells or disturbed awake? Other curses could be nature gone wild, magic or science accidents. Lepergnomes... 
* *Utopic/Dystopic*: Take the extremes of perfection and apocalyptic worlds and turn it into a tale. These sometimes require a setting, but can work as a singular event or campaign.
* *Body Horror*: This type can truly disturb or freak out your players. The body turning on itself or against the owners mind, twisted creations, shaped flesh can delve far into descriptions that can sicken. But the tales can also be incredible.

**Define the intent of the horror, what causes and draws it, what does it want.** Some things are inherently dark, such as demons. They may have a clear order to destroy or kill in key locations to summon others of its kind. And others can be gray. A noble may want to remove rivals, gaining control of a city or kingdom through magic and war. A holy paladin may fall to their zealot need, moving from cleansing and preaching to destroying all in their path...convert or die. This desire gives evil a realistic edge that can concern and terrify.

**Define the acts of this evil.** There are clear actions considered evil or twisted to become evil. Players can track these acts, the plans and effects, to find and deal with the evil or their adversary. Here are some examples:

* Cheating and breaking rules for personal gain, forcing others to do their dirty work, twisting simple rules into life breaking situations. This can edge into greed, another intent that leads to many evil actions.
* Theft of items, people, and riches by themselves or through others. Hiring the players to steal something, killing all witnesses, seem beneficial but soon drives them all into darker actions.
* Betrayal through a simple lie, earning and destroying trust at just the right moment, committed intentially for gain, to protect others, under duress, and so on. A paladin could betray faith, king their people, a lover their loved.
* Murder is the destruction of others. The evil is a delight in ending lives, an expression of power, a willingness to answer a call or demand, all for a specific goal.
* Vengeance can lead to a series of evil acts all to gain ultimate revenge. These can occur by the hand of the villain or induced through others, even the players. 
* Worship of dark powers to gain some end. Demons, gods, ghosts, so many supernatural entities wander the world waiting to be called or sated through dark arts. 

**Provide multiple methods of ending the evil.** Players may miss the one or two clues you place before them, or come up with incredible ideas of their own to solve the problems. Write up a few ideas of what created the evil, how did it get to this point, and how to solve it. For example, if summoned through a ritual, will breaking it actually send it back or release it for greater evil? What then?

**Create a believable evil with greatness and faults.** A mustache twirling, laughing, ultra powerful villain with vampire and werewolf curses without weaknesses is boring and far more ridiculous than dark. For every strength, give it a flaw. Listing these invigorate a story and generate so many options for dark acts and ending threats.

**Expand or change existing history and mythos with care.** Integrating aspects of the game world you are in is excellent, but shifting major timelines, historic events, or well-known NPCs might cause players to focus on continuity or their favorite arguments of lore than interacting with your story. Borrow and flavor, and feel free to create something new and fresh. Not everyone needs to be Arthas Jr.

**Evil does not have to start evil.** The road to hell is paved with good intentions is a perfect quote for expansive horror. Starting with a sense of lightness and goodness juxtaposed to the players revelations that their actions are truly despicable may envelop the seemingly fine tale with a dawning horror. Characters may see a foil or mirror to their views, actions, and past with a sudden clashing of their future writ in this evil before them.

## Building a Horror Event

To build an entire horror campaign starts with smaller ideas, key villains, and arcing plots. Before coming up with a campaign, let's start with an initial event to start. For these steps, we will create two types of horror events: psychological horror and  splatterfest gore horror.

See [How to Run Events & Campaigns](best-practice.md) for information and the following tips for horror:

* Give your event and horror a theme. This can help you form ideas and give your players expectations. For example: ravaged by a curse, haunted mansion, rise of the dead, ritual gone bad, becoming a lich, death knights breaking from service, the fallen rightous, monster attacks, stolen artifact of a major power, murderous designs.
* If the evil can be ended, have multiple methods for players to learn what is needed, materials/weapons/prayers to end the threat, NPCs to aid in resolving issues, and other ideas for conflict. If you tie everything to one or two places and items, they may not catch on and miss opportunities.
* Provide NPCs and items that will have details to help, some may not know what they have or found, some may demand payment for the information. This can also be an interesting hook for a fight, learning the past, determining weaknesses, creating a solution, and so on.
* Consider asking your players for backstory information or some of their fears. You can use these pieces to enhance and personalize the dark aspects touching on their personal story.

### Craft the Villain

Every tale of terror has an antagonist, be it a person, location, supernatural element, and so on. To increase the drama and tale, consider building this villain as you would the entire campaign or a character you would love to play. Give them strengths and flaws, capable of bein truly diabolical or aiding others to become horrific. While I could write a ton of ideas, [WoW DMing](https://discord.gg/RNT6sv9) DM Craft has tackled that for us! 

For a great guide on crafting villains, see [DM Craft's Antagonist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCiAq1DM3SOYQm0cVX3L34HkXBE8bOZbJ_QcG1DMbSI/edit) guide.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSn_gXuLiuw-psDCKwJfCUxpto4djovHJMVMeDdItv7sy5lrpjV_L0HKxw9BDNqsgVDKvaXQv5u1q19/pub?embedded=true#view=fith" width="100%" height="500px;"></iframe>

You may also use an uncommon villain, such as a curse or location:

<div id="vhilit">

* **Determine the level of intelligence.** Is the location alive and aware or merely destroyed, dangerous, and reactive? A landscape of seething from a magical war or natural disaster may actively provide challenges to the players. They may need to cleanse, rebuild, deal with the dead, etc. If it is intelligent, players may feel watched, trees and earth may try to swallow them, animals driven to attack, etc. For curses and contagions, it may be virulent and medical infecting, or parasidic with an agenda and awareness through those it consumes.
* **Define what is required to end the threat.** Do they need to cleanse the area, destroy an artifact, collect stolen items from a tomb? Can the illness be treated, how does magic affect it? 
* **Build a history for the dark location/curse.** A terrible battle, death, or spirit may have fallen on the land causing this change. The curse may have been seen before, enscrolled by casters or laid by fiends/celestials. Crafting a backstory gives you details to aid players and enrich key scenes.
* **Provide multiple methods to learn the secrets, while considering dark prices to pay for it.** If they can't get to a library, perhaps they need to pay an eldering crone for insight, get sick with the illness to provide feedback, sacrifice something important to a higher power, and so on. Don't forget the horror aspect, demand a tithe.

</div>

### Set the Horror Stage
Determine what the horror event is. This could be a couple sentences, which gives you something fantastic to give players when starting the event.

<div id="vhilit">

* **Lady VanDain's Invitation**: Psychological horror of a haunted mansion where the host has turned trespassers and visitors into statuary in a garden, extending the life of a dying child with their enchantment. The party arrives based on your story needs, such as a summons by a host, investigating lost friends, seeking a missing carriage, or idle curiosity.
* **Mark of the Golden Hand**: A slaughter horror adventure set in a market fallen to a cult. Those in the city district that fell asleep now waken to chanting outside their windows, a pain in their palms. There a brilliant sigil of some maddening language burns. Cultists have started killing all of those marked, blood for the blood god.

</div>

### Set the Goals
Any event type can have horror elements woven through it: battles, scouting, investigations, social events, magic, healing, and so on. Goals give players a focus to seek or complete while moving through your story, and give you story arcs to develop dark and light moments to let the event breath. Too much horror without pause can upset or push too far for some players.

* *Battle*: Warring through normal creatures until they reach the terrifying leader or boss. The enemies may increase in madness, twisted body horror, reasons for battle, or tasks the players may need to complete per group until reaching the final boss.
* *Exploration*: Wandering through a seemingly normal land that shifts with darker corruption as they pass through key locations affected by curses, items, villains, or magic. Perhaps the entire area twists and rips apart, or holds living nightmares, until the players complete a ritual.
* *Investigation*: These events have endless horror options:

  * Tracking down a death has many aspects of horror to delve through including the reason of death, method of killing, curses and magic, become a ghost, soul stolen, serial slaying, something missing from the body, ritual death, etc. 
  * Seeking lost items can also lead into horror such as soul bound artifacts, eye of a demon, holy sword of a dark god, tome of ancient secrets (necronomicon), scrolls of forbidden magic, etc. 
  * Hunting bounties or kidnapped people have opportunities of reasons for the capture such as nobles, pure blood, prophecies, hired, returning cult members, etc.

* *Social*: A grand ball, meeting of allies, diplomacy council, tea time with the ladies, all of these social situations could have goals and darkness added for flavor without falling into battle. A dark figure with a reason to cause a person or group fall to corruption, or set groups into fighting later, could greet and afflict the event with aspects of horror. Perhaps they add something to drinks/food, curse the location with magic, threaten and hold players hostage, use illusions to look like others twisting a situation, etc.
* *Magic*: Your imagination is the limit for creating magical horror. Consider the senses, soul, and aspects of magic when involving evil: sacrifices, strange language, use of blood/collected materials, mind-afflicting runes, etc. Also consider the source of magic: dark deals, fiends, zealot celestials, pacts with enemy forces, murder, liches, etc.

## How to Write Horror

When developing your events and campaigns, I recommend writing content for scenes for easy copying and pasting. These can be descriptive phrases, lists of words, full paragraphs, and insights. But how do you write for horror?

<div id="vhilit">

**Be descriptive considering all of the senses.** Details bring horror to life just like other events. Beyond simple sight, what does something feel like, scents on the air, sounds in the area or outside, a taste on the air or if something is sipped or licked. 

**Create lists of words that evoke emotion.** Saying something is terrifying, horrific, spooky, creepy, and dangerous all sound like saying food is great. What does great food taste like? Give serious thought to potential colors, flavors, expressive and simple words mixed together, and so on. You don't need to write like Lovecraft, just expand your thoughts.

**Write a short story about the event or scenario.** Flexing your thoughts and delving into the focus of evil, craft a short story or journal. Remember to include strengths and weaknesses, too perfect and powerful leaves players not invested or able to relate to the horror. If getting into the mind of the horror is difficult, consider writing as a witness, investigator, or victim. React and freely write, don't worry about perfect voice and grammar.

**Perhaps also consider another sense...emotion.** You should never dictate how a player feels about a scene. but you can give them a sense of emotion you want to covery or evoke in them through the environment, beasts, and NPCs. You have full control of these actors on your stage.

**Embrace music.** Soundtracks give you a perfect score to layer your words against. Pick some songs and listen as you write. If they aid in chilling, save links and songs, create a playlist. Weave these into music available through Discord or Watch2gether to play during events.

</div>

### Writing Exercise

A great exercise to find your dark voice is to search for a piece of art that disturbs you (painting, scene, movie trailer, character) and write about it. Consider every sense to evoke a felt place and specific sensation. Need a little help? Reach for a [thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com/) and writer resources, such as [240 Dark Words](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/word-lists/240-dark-words-for-more-descriptive-writing.html). 

For this exercise, determine the emotions you want to convey, the kind of horror, consider colors, seasons, imagery, to find little details for players to latch on to. 

<div id="vhilit">

* **Emotion to convey**: List ideas of feeling and sensations you want the reader to feel, list words you may want to use
* **Senses to focus on**: Color, scent, sounds can help a mind fill in details through imagination
* **Aspect of horror**: What kind of horror elements do you want to highlight

<div id="vhilit">

* **Emotion to convey**: Unsettled, moldering house and slight rot points to the inherent darkness in the location and owner
* **Senses to focus on**: Tarnished gold, patina of rotted greens, neverending autumn on the verge of winter, sickly sweet
* **Aspect of horror**: Corruption and madness, the sacrifices for saving a child have pushed the lady of the house into dark magics and madness

</div>

The letter arrived in the passing of days to each of the company. Crisp night-inked script itched across fine bone-white parchment with hints of pressed flower, a scent of orchid and sea-- it spoke of refinement, greed, and a woman. When the call to war lead us to the distant shores of Kul'tiras, we aided the Lord of Waycrest Manor to safeguard the populace and deal with constant incursions of a witchly sort. Never once did we meet his beloved wife and child, only hearing of them from his fond memories.

To learn of his death in such a way as this only reminded me of how the ills of home and nation, the constant warfare, had worn to fraying the ties of new friendships. Yet looking over these penned words again, and seeing the darkened windows and loaming walls of Waycrest, I must give pause until the rest of my party arrives. Best to enter together, my courage failing.

*Long have the nights become. I bid you welcome to my estates, dear friends of my late departed lord. You aided him in times most dire, and sought to end threats beleaguring our people. Come and allow me to repay the honors you have imparted.*

Spires seem to lean toward me as curled fingers. Flitting azure shades move against the hand-blown glass, a rattle in them despite the stillness of air. The taste of the ocean in the mist sharpens the senses, biting harder in my jaw already tight from some concern I can't place. The creak of saddle leather and nearing crack of shoed hooves under me tell me even my steed wishes to return to the open road. 

Nearly turning away, the door opens and a familiar face brightens the near night with a child's warmth, little Katya. The tension burst like a soap bubble, perhaps battle senses and too many days of ill omens and war leaving me sensitive. Nothing but memories here, no true ghosts. Though I cannot deny the chill on my arm as I lift the lord's only daughter, tossing her in welcome as soft laughter fills the air.

Past the threshold, she prattles of childish tidings, tea time with dollies, the lessons in pony riding, cook catching a fish big enough to swallow her whole. The home holds far too much warmth, unlike my expectations. A blazing hearth stuffed of old coals and fresh wood leaves a sharp glow through the room, subduing the gentle candleglow at sweeping stairs. Flowers festoon vases, float in a bowl of herbed water for washing hands in the foyer, painted in large canvases of the lord and his family. A few petals fall, edges darkened, cracked, withering as they land.

Here the scent of orchid and cracking hearth push away something sweeter, a scent that causes the echo of battlefields in the northern kingdoms to ring in my ears again. Then she descends the stairs, or perhaps was always there waiting by the ballistrad, hand resting on the railing, the other reaching to take mine in greeting. Light casts her features in a ghoulish glow, motes in wide eyes like the final rays of the sun at sunset driven back by storms. Swathed in heavy layers, she seemed frozen in garb despite the oppressive heat. 

"Thank you for attending my request. If Frederick was only here, he truly would welcome your visit. Come, you must need rest before dinner."

#### Grand Designs

<div id="vhilit">

* **Emotion to convey**: Heart thundering fear, excitement, speed
* **Senses to focus on**: Glimmering golds of holy light, blood and scarlet reds, chanting, wet sounds
* **Aspect of horror**: Bloodbath of death, alien presence

</div>

*Athul nak'vach'thurl... Mua'tollvex... Heralds fall upon the mark... Accept our gift...*

Waking with a sharp twist in bedding, interrupted in conversations with friends in the tavern, startled during nightly prayers recounting the moments of your day -- whatever you sought in the deep night ends abruptly. Through windows, harsh glows spark and flash, an infernal firelight licking at the sky yet nothing of smoke or char hangs in the air. Drops speckle the glass, vermillion rain of the dying. 

Calls for aid echo outside the tavern, loud banging of fists on the door...falling silent with a gasp. Weight falls upon the wood, requiring force to shove open. A robed figure pulls free a blade from the newly fallen, blood dripping from the scarlet caked metal.

"Athul nak'vach'thurl! Mua'tollvex!" Spittle flies from shouting lips, wild eyes fall on you all in the common room, rushing in the moment of surprise. The face familiar, having sold simple jewelry in a stall of azure silks mere hours before. Purpose turned to a new currency sends him smashing through the doorway. 

The battle enjoins as the killer leaps at each of you with arcing slashes, the blade hungering and pulling to seek your flesh!

As the battle ensues, flashes blind and burn from golden lightning through the open door and window. They stream across, landing beyond sight, lost behind buildings and market stalls. Each of you tear away at the robed man, blood splattering wet across the scuffed floor, darkening tattered robes and clothing. Breath froths at lips and nose, as the last glow of life burns. 

"Mua'tollvex..." Breath catches in a final gurgle, as pain sharp and heated lances in your palm. Each of you gasp and grip at bare or gloved hands, the gleam of a sigil flared to life that left the freshly killed man to mark you. *Accept our gift.*

Stumbling into the night, many townsfolk and merchant lay in broken heaps. Details of faces caught in rictus of surprise and pain caught in scarlet light edged in golds. Softly shifting hues of dawn, motes of brightness lifting to the heavens, lure your sight to the end of the city block. More flickers of streaming gold leave newly killed to seek that shimmer, joining it in harmony.

And the rythmic song of cultist chanting strengthens.
