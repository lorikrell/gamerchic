*Hundreds of birds flock into trees surrounding a property, watchful and silent as anyone nears the gates. All the buyers of a fine sword all seem to die within a year of owning it, killed by the blade. Your favorite fruit seller has gone missing and no one seems to remember them...only you. Members of your hunting party camp in the old stones of a fallen house, and wake to find matching symbols tattooed on each of your hands. Local fisherman speak of a lights on a small island in the lake, but none dare go near it. You and a group of strangers arrive to a tower in the mountains, invited by a lady few remember, inviting you all to a late dinner... Farmer Peters has the finest apples in the county and a terrifying scarecrow in the orchard wearing a familiar old cloak. Prayers to a new statue in the old church seem to come true, then turn sour.*

What is horror? A sense of fright, feeling off? A moment that strikes and earns a yelp of surprise? A rising tension that claims your breath and makes you want to run, yet you cannot move? An anger that consumes the senses and spurs a terrible need to destroy everything around you? A chilling silence and absence of...everything? 

Horror events and campaigns delve into not only the macabre (disturbing depictions of death and injury), but into situations and sensations that leave us uncomforatble. The genre highlights a series of situations with growing unease and complexity, even a slasher flick has a complicated backstory and splinter of true fear beyond brutal murder. This guide helps you find your way through creating and running these events. 

:::sonceri Game Genres
This guide can be used for World of Warcraft (WoW) in-game events, tabletop games, LARPs, and more! Some of the terminology may be geared to WoW or a d20 system, but anyone can use it for any genre. The rolling rules are for a d20 system, but you could easily convert this to a d10 World of Darkness table of successes and botches, d6 Shadowrun system, and so on.

## What makes a good horror tale?

Before plotting out terrifying scenes, let's consider the elements of a good horror story.
Dark events begin with normal circumstances and touches of something off-kilter, uncertain, or out-of-place. You build upon these elements, leading through the senses and mixing history and lore. Woven details. Rushing players through an area, mentioning something lurks in the dark, and ending in a sudden gory scene with exquisite details of dismemberment and lustful wrath is not quite horror. But giving the killer some backstory unearthed through discussions, investigations, and strange interactions touched with a series of incidents forwarning the inevitable definitely could frighten.

What frightens you and your players may differ greatly as these tales depend on subjective fear. Simply throwing a ton of blood and skulls in a room may not send the warrior half-orc running for the hills. A creepy noble sharing the same cat eyes as the feline settled in his lap may not concern an elven druid of the wild. There are methods to twist and turn these scenes to make those hardened folk quake.

Likewise, delving too far into horror can send players running or disturb them, not their characters. Driving players on a Cthulhu mythos journey of extreme details in madness, people carving each other up, gory ritual circles, without pausing to breath can end badly. Using too many real-world images and catastrophes, personal histories of players, or surgical levels of detail can sicken rather than disturb.  

> *Strike a balance in details, between gore and darkness, between realism and magic.*

:::sonceri Rate Your Event & Warn Your Players
When you run these events, always let your players know what they are in for! Not many players want extreme levels of horror, they may have nightmares or retch from descriptions. Consider giving your event a level of horror from 1 (light acts of evil) to 5 (Cthulhu is at the door) and a genre description. Some folks may run in terror away from a body horror event and arrive excited for a ghost story.

## Horror Building Blocks

The following are a few building blocks of story and mechanics to consider when creating investigations.

<div id="vhilit">

**Determine what haunts or hunts the story.** The story can include multiple facets of horror, but needs a clear focus for the core of it. Is it a villain, an object, a location, a person, history, magic, religion, and so on. 

**Decide on what kind of fear and horror you want to express.** This gives you a theme to work with. Here are some theme examples:

* *Gorefest*: A joyride through death like Mad Max Fury Road or Freddy in Nightmare on Elm Street. War, murder, deviltry all with a high death count can be the crux of horror. What would players to do stop it? What is driving the murder?
* *Hooked on a Feeling*: Typically considered a psychological horror, pick an emotion and take it too far. How can love become twisted and torn? Perhaps the antagonist kills everyone in their path to gain the object of their desire, lying, killing, and capitalizing on situations. What would the villain need to commit for a perfect sense of peace? They may need to destroy all considered evil or mind control those that refuse to live by the rules.
* *Ghost Stories*: Look through all of the amazing supernatural ghosts available and craft a tale. Why does it remain, not contiuing to their afterlife? What will players need to resolve? 
* Aberration Terror: These are creatures from the beyond, cosmic horror, strange and alien concepts that cause madness. How do you dispel or return the evil? Who brought it and what keeps it here? How do you stop something summoned by cults or reawakened by accidental sacrifice in an old ruin, or released from magicial bonds.
* *Cursed Creations*: These are considered classic cult creatures including vampires, werewolves, and mummies. They have intelligence, a past. Are they tragic, long lived and hating it? Do they despise themselves and seek to spread the curse? Are they awakened by rituals and spells or disturbed awake? Other curses could be nature gone wild, magic or science accidents. Lepergnomes... 
* *Utopic/Dystopic*: Take the extremes of perfection and apocalyptic worlds and turn it into a tale. These sometimes require a setting, but can work as a singular event or campaign.
* *Body Horror*: This type can truly disturb or freak out your players. The body turning on itself or against the owners mind, twisted creations, shaped flesh can delve far into descriptions that can sicken. But the tales can also be incredible.

**Define the intent of the horror, what causes and draws it, what does it want.** Some things are inherently dark, such as demons. They may have a clear order to destroy or kill in key locations to summon others of its kind. And others can be gray. A noble may want to remove rivals, gaining control of a city or kingdom through magic and war. A holy paladin may fall to their zealot need, moving from cleansing and preaching to destroying all in their path...convert or die. This desire gives evil a realistic edge that can concern and terrify.

**Define the acts of this evil.** There are clear actions considered evil or twisted to become evil. Players can track these acts, the plans and effects, to find and deal with the evil or their adversary. Here are some examples:

* Cheating and breaking rules for personal gain, forcing others to do their dirty work, twisting simple rules into life breaking situations. This can edge into greed, another intent that leads to many evil actions.
* Theft of items, people, and riches by themselves or through others. Hiring the players to steal something, killing all witnesses, seem beneficial but soon drives them all into darker actions.
* Betrayal through a simple lie, earning and destroying trust at just the right moment, committed intentially for gain, to protect others, under duress, and so on. A paladin could betray faith, king their people, a lover their loved.
* Murder is the destruction of others. The evil is a delight in ending lives, an expression of power, a willingness to answer a call or demand, all for a specific goal.
* Vengeance can lead to a series of evil acts all to gain ultimate revenge. These can occur by the hand of the villain or induced through others, even the players. 
* Worship of dark powers to gain some end. Demons, gods, ghosts, so many supernatural entities wander the world waiting to be called or sated through dark arts. 

**Provide multiple methods of ending the evil.** Players may miss the one or two clues you place before them, or come up with incredible ideas of their own to solve the problems. Write up a few ideas of what created the evil, how did it get to this point, and how to solve it. For example, if summoned through a ritual, will breaking it actually send it back or release it for greater evil? What then?

**Create a believable evil with greatness and faults.** A mustache twirling, laughing, ultra powerful villain with vampire and werewolf curses without weaknesses is boring and far more ridiculous than dark. For every strength, give it a flaw. Listing these invigorate a story and generate so many options for dark acts and ending threats.

**Expand or change existing history and mythos with care.** Integrating aspects of the game world you are in is excellent, but shifting major timelines, historic events, or well-known NPCs might cause players to focus on continuity or their favorite arguments of lore than interacting with your story. Borrow and flavor, and feel free to create something new and fresh. Not everyone needs to be Arthas Jr.

**Evil does not have to start evil.** The road to hell is paved with good intentions is a perfect quote for expansive horror. Starting with a sense of lightness and goodness juxtaposed to the players revelations that their actions are truly despicable may envelop the seemingly fine tale with a dawning horror. Characters may see a foil or mirror to their views, actions, and past with a sudden clashing of their future writ in this evil before them.

## How to Write Horror

When developing your events and campaigns, I recommend writing content for scenes for easy copying and pasting. These can be descriptive phrases, lists of words, full paragraphs, and insights. But how do you write for horror?

<div id="vhilit">

**Be descriptive considering all of the senses.** Details bring horror to life just like other events. Beyond simple sight, what does something feel like, scents on the air, sounds in the area or outside, a taste on the air or if something is sipped or licked. 

**Create lists of words that evoke emotion.** Saying something is terrifying, horrific, spooky, creepy, and dangerous all sound like saying food is great. What does great food taste like? Give serious thought to potential colors, flavors, expressive and simple words mixed together, and so on. You don't need to write like Lovecraft, just expand your thoughts.

**Write a short story about the event or scenario.** Flexing your thoughts and delving into the focus of evil, craft a short story or journal. Remember to include strengths and weaknesses, too perfect and powerful leaves players not invested or able to relate to the horror. If getting into the mind of the horror is difficult, consider writing as a witness, investigator, or victim. React and freely write, don't worry about perfect voice and grammar.

**Perhaps also consider another sense...emotion.** You should never dictate how a player feels about a scene. but you can give them a sense of emotion you want to covery or evoke in them through the environment, beasts, and NPCs. You have full control of these actors on your stage.

**Embrace music.** Soundtracks give you a perfect score to layer your words against. Pick some songs and listen as you write. If they aid in chilling, save links and songs, create a playlist. Weave these into music available through Discord or Watch2gether to play during events.

</div>

### Writing Exercise

A great exercise to find your dark voice is to search for a piece of art that disturbs you (painting, scene, movie trailer, but of dialogue) and write about it. Now write about this piece using ever sense. Need a little help? Reach for a [thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com/)! Writer resources can also help, like [240 Dark Words](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/word-lists/240-dark-words-for-more-descriptive-writing.html).
