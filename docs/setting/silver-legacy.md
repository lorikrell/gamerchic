Magic has touched all of our lives. Ancestors reveled in power, calling to spirit and building empires. Some cultures turned from magic and damned it from use, only for it to be embraced by future generations. Spirits and gods touched the devoted, divine of paths lit by sun, moon, and the everdark. Elementals bend to the demands of those that summon. By researching these creations of the past, we can glean lessons for the future. 

The Silver Legacy collects magical knowledge, restores artifacts, and helps deal with dangerous magics. They have a growing history aiding with archeological sites, translating ancient runes and languages, and identifying magics lost and found.
