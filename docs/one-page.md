Warcraft has a wealth of zone or land and nation maps, dungeon maps, icons, 3d models, and resources to pull together and create adventures. You may find so many options and resources that you could get LOST! 

The easiest way to get started, plan, and run an event is to create a one page adventure. A fantastic way to craft this event is to use a dungeon or raid instance.

:::sonceri Guide Example
For this guide, I'm using World of Warcraft as an example for building these events. You can use anything from a tabletop battlemap drawn by many incredible artists, any MMO-RPG or RPG game like Final Fantasy XIV or Skyrim, even maps from real world locations and archeology can give you great options. Get creative and inventive!

## How this works!

In Warcraft, dungeons can take 5 people and raids from 10 to 40 people. You have a wealth of options, including some outdoor instance areas that never restrict the amount of people you bring. Each of these locations includes nicely drawn maps to snag, add details, plan your event, or use directly in a Discord or virtual tabletop like Roll20.

Let's go!

1. Find and grab a map.
1. Create a Google Drawing or Google Slide. Add text, icons, loot, info, etc.
1. Share a view link for your adventure.

## Plan Your Event

Think about all of the incredible dungeons and raids in the game. Give some thought to the enemies you want to showcase, look and feel of the environment, special places for those epic fights or investigations. You can find a wealth of maps and resources from many Warcraft site, including:

* [Warcraft WoWpedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com) for info, lore, guides, and maps
* [WoWHead](http://www.wowhead.com) for icons, 3D images, guides, and more
