Created by [White Wolf/Onyx Path](http://theonyxpath.com/), World of Darkness is a world of supernatural horror and intrigue hidden in plain sight. The setting has a few different ages (Dark Ages, Victorian, and Modern) giving players and storytellers a rich setting to be the original terrors of the world: vampires, werewolves, fae, ghosts, mummies, demons, hunters, and many other creatures living among the normal folk. They feature settings across the globe and mythos, with various cultures and ideas presented. All stories and backgrounds are told from the victors and fallen, leaving you the diviner of truth.

It has two major setting lines: [World of Darkness](https://www.worldofdarkness.com/) (classic) and Chronicles of Darkness (new). Both have fascinating tales and options, numerous versions and tomes, and some of the best writing and art available in any game line.
