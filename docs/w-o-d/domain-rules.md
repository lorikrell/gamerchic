Determine what your rules and regulations are for visiting, entering, and hunting in your domain. Most cities include the usual rules depending on Camarilla, Sabbat, Anarchs, and Independents. Sometimes itâ€™s best to consider what you do and do not allow from random Kindred in the city. 

The following are examples to help you build rules to keep people in line or use against them:

* No hunting allowed without direct approval from the domain owner.
* Announce your arrival in the domain and your business in it at a specific location, by text mes-sage to a specific number, etc.
* Bring a gift of some kind when seeking business with the domain owner. Maybe you collect glass figurines or spoons.
* Do not perform any business in the domain without approval and a contract with the do-main owner. For example, you may want a con-tracted cut of drug sells.
* Do not kill, fight, or start a disturbance with kindred or kine in the domain.
* Everyone is considered neutral in your domain. No extradition policy.
* No kindred hobos allowed in your domain. If you need a place to stay, meet with the owner.
* No ghouls from other kindred allowed without missive, signet ring, a phone call, a letter with blood mark, etc. 
* Do not bring blood dolls when visiting. You may have far better feasting options. Gifts of blood may be welcomed.
* Dress code enforced at all times. You may have a fine bar or restaurant requiring suit and tie and fancy dress.
